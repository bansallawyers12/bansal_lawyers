# CSS Files That Can Be Safely Deleted

**Status:** ✅ **DELETION COMPLETED**

This document lists CSS files that were safely removed from the project. Files are categorized by reason for deletion.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Build files** can be regenerated by running `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
- **Source files** that are no longer referenced can be safely removed
- Always test the application after deletion to ensure nothing breaks

---

## 1. Generated Build Files (Can be regenerated)
These files are automatically generated by Vite during the build process. They can be safely deleted and will be recreated on the next build.

### Location: `public/build/assets/`
- `vendor-frontend-mTWX0Shs.css` (or similar hash-named files)
- `vendor-admin-BMk20h4e.css` (or similar hash-named files)
- `frontend-Be7eXVTV.css` (or similar hash-named files)
- `app-AyJ7io-g.css` (or similar hash-named files)
- `admin-DnISDPN6.css` (or similar hash-named files)

**Note:** The entire `public/build/` directory can be deleted and will be regenerated.

---

## 2. Unused SCSS Source Files
These SCSS files are not referenced in the current Vite build configuration.

### Location: `public/scss/`
**Status:** ❌ **ENTIRE DIRECTORY UNUSED**
- The entire `public/scss/` directory (91 files) appears to be unused
- No references found in the codebase
- This includes:
  - `public/scss/style.scss`
  - `public/scss/bootstrap/**/*.scss` (all Bootstrap SCSS files)
  - All utility and mixin files

**Reason:** The project now uses Vite with CSS files in `resources/css/` instead of SCSS compilation from `public/scss/`.

### Location: `resources/sass/`
- `resources/sass/app.scss` - Only referenced in old webpack build (not used by Vite)
- `resources/sass/_variables.scss` - Only used by app.scss

**Reason:** The project uses Tailwind CSS and custom CSS in `resources/css/` instead of this SASS setup.

---

## 3. Potentially Unused CSS Files
These files might be redundant or replaced by other loading methods.

### Location: `public/css/`
- `fullcalendar.min.css` - **✅ SAFE TO DELETE**
  - FullCalendar CSS is now loaded via CDN in `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`
  - No references found to the local file
  - Can be safely deleted

- `dataTables.bootstrap4.css` - **⚠️ KEEP (Used by admin-datatables.js)**
  - Imported in `resources/js/admin-datatables.js` (line 5)
  - This file is used when admin-datatables.js is loaded
  - However, the admin layout uses `dataTables_min_latest.css` instead
  - **Recommendation:** Keep for now, but could be removed if admin-datatables.js is not used

---

## 4. SCSS Versions of Font Files
If CSS versions are being used, these SCSS versions can be removed.

### Location: `public/fonts/`
- `public/fonts/ionicons/css/_ionicons.scss` - SCSS version (CSS version is used)
- `public/fonts/flaticon/font/_flaticon.scss` - SCSS version (CSS version is used)

**Reason:** The layouts use the `.min.css` versions, not the SCSS versions.

---

## 5. TinyMCE CSS Files (Keep - Required)
**DO NOT DELETE** - These are required for the TinyMCE editor to function properly.

### Location: `public/assets/tinymce/skins/**/*.css`
All TinyMCE CSS files should be kept as they are dynamically loaded by the editor.

---

## Summary

### Safe to Delete Immediately:
1. ✅ `public/build/assets/*.css` (all build files - will regenerate)
2. ✅ `public/scss/` (entire directory - 91 files)
3. ✅ `resources/sass/app.scss`
4. ✅ `resources/sass/_variables.scss`
5. ✅ `public/fonts/ionicons/css/_ionicons.scss`
6. ✅ `public/fonts/flaticon/font/_flaticon.scss`
7. ✅ `public/css/fullcalendar.min.css` (FullCalendar now uses CDN)

### Verify Before Deleting:
1. ✅ `public/css/fullcalendar.min.css` - **SAFE TO DELETE** (FullCalendar now uses CDN)
2. ⚠️ `public/css/dataTables.bootstrap4.css` - Keep (used by admin-datatables.js if it's loaded)

### Estimated Space Savings:
- Build files: ~500KB - 2MB (regenerates)
- SCSS directory: ~2-5MB
- Total: ~2-7MB of source files
