I wanted some guidance on what to do increase my employability chances as my main aim is to settle in Australia permanently. My visa expires on 30th September 2026 and I am worried I won\'t get a job in time.

I got recently 485 refusal with AFP check timing issue. Please see the excerpt from the decsion letter:\r\n\r\n\"A valid application for a Temporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa has been\r\nmade by the applicant.\r\nA visa cannot be granted unless the relevant criteria specified in the Migration Regulations\r\nare satisfied. In this case, I am not satisfied that clause 485.213 in Schedule 2 of the\r\nMigration Regulations is met. This clause provides that:\r\n485.213\r\n(1) When the application was made, it was accompanied by evidence that:\r\n(a) the applicant; and\r\n(b) each person included in the application who is at least 16;\r\nhad applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12 months\r\nimmediately before the day the application is made.\r\n(2) Subclause (1) does not apply to an applicant who meets the requirements of clause\r\n485.232, 485.233, 485.234 or 485.235.\r\nWhen a Temporary Graduate (Subclass 485) visa is lodged, it must be accompanied by\r\nevidence that the applicant has applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12\r\nmonths immediately before the day the application is made.\r\nAssessment\r\nOn 9 March 2025 the applicant lodged an application for a (Post-Higher Education Work\r\nstream) (Subclass 485) visa. The applicant declared Yes to:\r\nHave you and all persons included in this application who are 16 years of age or over,\r\napplied in the last 12 months to the Australian Federal Police for a check of criminal records?\r\nThe applicant provided the official invoice from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as\r\nsupporting evidence at the time of their application.\r\nOn 28 April 2025, the application was assessed by the delegate based on the evidence\r\nprovided with their application. The evidence provided specifies that the application for the\r\nAustralian Federal Police check was lodged on 9 March 2025, which is the same day the\r\nTemporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa was lodged.\r\nAs the applicant did not apply for an Australian Federal Police clearance during the\r\n12 months immediately before the day they lodged their visa application, I find the applicant\r\ndoes not satisfy the requirements of Regulation 485.213.\r\nDecision\r\nAs clause 485.213 is not met by the applicant, I find the criteria for the grant of a Temporary\r\nGraduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa in the Post-Higher Education Work stream are\r\nnot met by the applicant, and thus the applicant does not meet the criteria for the grant of a\r\nTemporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa. I therefore find the criteria for the\r\ngrant of a Temporary Graduate visa are not met by the applicant.\r\nTherefore, I refuse the application by the applicant for a Temporary Graduate visa.\r\nAs the application has been assessed as not meeting the requirements of clause 485.213, I\r\nhave not assessed the application further against the requirements of this subclass.\"\r\n\r\nCould you please have a call with me and let me know. I am really bad place and feeling completely lost.</span> <p class=\"text-semi-light-grey col-v-1\">@ 10:30 AM-11:00 AM</p></div>', '2025-04-29 19:58:53', '2025-04-29 19:58:53', 'scheduled an paid appointment', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Only Partnership VISA withdrawn and a letter was sent by home affairs stating the relationship has ended.\r\n3) Also Fear wife will apply for a divorce in Australia and use the proceedings to just to learn of husbands Personal details to provide for Indian courts? Wife is very vindictive.\r\n4) Is the Indian Judicial system able to reach out to me here in Australia and compel and force me to appear in court in Indian? Given that allegations (unfounded) made by the wife are serious - treated as criminal in India e.g. Allegations of Abuse etc.\r\n5) Upon visiting India - given even allegations (although false and unfounded) can result in non-bailable jail time till the process is concluded in court - Can I be detained if I visit India - seeking precautions and safety advice as an Australian citizen with essentially no Links in India other than this marriage.\r\n6) Will you be able to assist in helping the Husband in navigating this matter while collaborating with an Indian Legal Representative? You will also need to help me source a competent Indian Legal Representative.\r\nCONTEXT\r\n1) During the time of marriage Q1 2018 - Husband was an Australian citizen (No ID in India except for OCI) - wife was an Indian citizen.\r\n2) Marriage Certificate was obtained in India\r\n3) Partner visa applied in Australia by husband. Relationship issues ensued, husband withdrew the application. Wife accused (unfounded and false) DV (no substantiation - home affairs is non-judicial process) to get her permanent residency VISA - Wife obtained it in 2023\r\n4) Husband and Wife are living separately since June 2022. The acute time of relationship breakdown. Started much earlier. Wife was falsely accusing husband and family of many allegations to husbands friends and family + Indian charity ISC (Indian Support Center) since DEC 2021.\r\n5) Unknown if Wife has obtained Australian Citizenship\r\n6) Wife has sent email to me with false allegations of abuse/desertion etc. and asking for a mutual divorce if not she threatens court proceedings with above allegations. Asking for personal details (to serve court documents). Last week.\r\n7) Above actions seems out of the blue as couple were in a phase of reconciliation since Q3 2024 (still living separately). She supposedly went to visit her family in India. Calls were being declined. Then suddenly this email was sent. \r\n8) Wife followed up with WhatsApp messages, got ISC to reach out via email and tried to contact extended family - asking for husband person details for serving of court orders.\r\n9) Husband has not responded to anything. He is in a state of pain/sadness/disdain but also fears for consequences having heard the Indian Judicial system\'s biases etc. Wishes to Seek legal advice in Australia before doing so.</span> <p class=\"text-semi-light-grey col-v-1\">@ 12:30 PM-1:00 PM</p></div>', '2025-05-12 01:54:17', '2025-05-12 01:54:17', 'scheduled an paid appointment', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I got recently 485 refusal with AFP check timing issue. Please see the excerpt from the decsion letter:\r\n\r\n\"A valid application for a Temporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa has been\r\nmade by the applicant.\r\nA visa cannot be granted unless the relevant criteria specified in the Migration Regulations\r\nare satisfied. In this case, I am not satisfied that clause 485.213 in Schedule 2 of the\r\nMigration Regulations is met. This clause provides that:\r\n485.213\r\n(1) When the application was made, it was accompanied by evidence that:\r\n(a) the applicant; and\r\n(b) each person included in the application who is at least 16;\r\nhad applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12 months\r\nimmediately before the day the application is made.\r\n(2) Subclause (1) does not apply to an applicant who meets the requirements of clause\r\n485.232, 485.233, 485.234 or 485.235.\r\nWhen a Temporary Graduate (Subclass 485) visa is lodged, it must be accompanied by\r\nevidence that the applicant has applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12\r\nmonths immediately before the day the application is made.\r\nAssessment\r\nOn 9 March 2025 the applicant lodged an application for a (Post-Higher Education Work\r\nstream) (Subclass 485) visa. The applicant declared Yes to:\r\nHave you and all persons included in this application who are 16 years of age or over,\r\napplied in the last 12 months to the Australian Federal Police for a check of criminal records?\r\nThe applicant provided the official invoice from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as\r\nsupporting evidence at the time of their application.\r\nOn 28 April 2025, the application was assessed by the delegate based on the evidence\r\nprovided with their application. The evidence provided specifies that the application for the\r\nAustralian Federal Police check was lodged on 9 March 2025, which is the same day the\r\nTemporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa was lodged.\r\nAs the applicant did not apply for an Australian Federal Police clearance during the\r\n12 months immediately before the day they lodged their visa application, I find the applicant\r\ndoes not satisfy the requirements of Regulation 485.213.\r\nDecision\r\nAs clause 485.213 is not met by the applicant, I find the criteria for the grant of a Temporary\r\nGraduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa in the Post-Higher Education Work stream are\r\nnot met by the applicant, and thus the applicant does not meet the criteria for the grant of a\r\nTemporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa. I therefore find the criteria for the\r\ngrant of a Temporary Graduate visa are not met by the applicant.\r\nTherefore, I refuse the application by the applicant for a Temporary Graduate visa.\r\nAs the application has been assessed as not meeting the requirements of clause 485.213, I\r\nhave not assessed the application further against the requirements of this subclass.\"\r\n\r\nCould you please have a call with me and let me know.

Wife is very vindictive.\r\n4) Is the Indian Judicial system able to reach out to me here in Australia and compel and force me to appear in court in Indian? Given that allegations (unfounded) made by the wife are serious - treated as criminal in India e.g. Allegations of Abuse etc.\r\n5) Upon visiting India - given even allegations (although false and unfounded) can result in non-bailable jail time till the process is concluded in court - Can I be detained if I visit India - seeking precautions and safety advice as an Australian citizen with essentially no Links in India other than this marriage.\r\n6) Will you be able to assist in helping the Husband in navigating this matter while collaborating with an Indian Legal Representative? You will also need to help me source a competent Indian Legal Representative.\r\nCONTEXT\r\n1) During the time of marriage Q1 2018 - Husband was an Australian citizen (No ID in India except for OCI) - wife was an Indian citizen.\r\n2) Marriage Certificate was obtained in India\r\n3) Partner visa applied in Australia by husband. Relationship issues ensued, husband withdrew the application. Wife accused (unfounded and false) DV (no substantiation - home affairs is non-judicial process) to get her permanent residency VISA - Wife obtained it in 2023\r\n4) Husband and Wife are living separately since June 2022. The acute time of relationship breakdown. Started much earlier. Wife was falsely accusing husband and family of many allegations to husbands friends and family + Indian charity ISC (Indian Support Center) since DEC 2021.\r\n5) Unknown if Wife has obtained Australian Citizenship\r\n6) Wife has sent email to me with false allegations of abuse/desertion etc. and asking for a mutual divorce if not she threatens court proceedings with above allegations. Asking for personal details (to serve court documents). Last week.\r\n7) Above actions seems out of the blue as couple were in a phase of reconciliation since Q3 2024 (still living separately). She supposedly went to visit her family in India. Calls were being declined. Then suddenly this email was sent. \r\n8) Wife followed up with WhatsApp messages, got ISC to reach out via email and tried to contact extended family - asking for husband person details for serving of court orders.\r\n9) Husband has not responded to anything. He is in a state of pain/sadness/disdain but also fears for consequences having heard the Indian Judicial system\'s biases etc. Wishes to Seek legal advice in Australia before doing so.', '0', 'Phone', 10, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-05-12 01:54:17', '2025-05-12 01:54:17', 'client', 'tok_1RNcCeGP4bkr8OB0eOt1VWli', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Contract Disputes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Contracts form the foundation of any commercial relationship. When one party fails to meet its obligations, it can result in costly disputes. We assist clients in enforcing contracts or defending against breach of contract claims, whether related to service agreements, supply arrangements, lease contracts, or partnership deals. Our lawyers review contract terms, identify legal breaches, and represent clients in negotiation, mediation, or litigation, ensuring the best possible outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3><strong>2. Shareholder &amp; Partnership Disputes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Conflicts among business partners or shareholders can threaten the viability of a company. These may involve disagreements over profit sharing, strategic direction, breaches of shareholder agreements, mismanagement claims, or disputes regarding buy-outs and exit strategies. We help resolve these sensitive matters through clear legal guidance, dispute resolution processes, and, where necessary, court intervention. Our goal is to preserve business value while protecting our client&rsquo;s rights and investments.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3><strong>3. Director Duties &amp; Misconduct</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Company directors are legally bound by duties under the Corporations Act 2001, including acting in good faith, avoiding conflicts of interest, and exercising care and diligence. Allegations of director misconduct &mdash; such as fraud, negligence, or abuse of power &mdash; can lead to serious legal consequences. Bansal Lawyers provides legal defence and compliance advice to directors facing such claims, and we also act for shareholders or companies seeking redress for breaches of duty.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3><strong>4. Franchise &amp; Licensing Disputes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Franchisees and licensors often face disputes over non-compliance, misrepresentation, or unfair contract terms. We represent both franchisors and franchisees in resolving conflicts arising under franchise agreements, licensing arrangements, or intellectual property use. Whether it&rsquo;s termination issues, performance obligations, or enforcement of exclusivity clauses, our legal team ensures your rights are protected under the <strong>Franchising Code of Conduct</strong> and other relevant laws.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3><strong>5. Employment-Related Claims</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Employment disputes can severely impact workplace morale and expose businesses to financial and reputational risks. We assist employers in managing claims involving unfair dismissal, workplace harassment, wage disputes, breaches of employment contracts, and adverse action claims under the <strong>Fair Work Act</strong>. Our services include proactive legal advice, employee contract review, workplace investigations, and representation before industrial tribunals and courts.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Why Choose Bansal Lawyers?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Strategic Advice</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"> &ndash; We offer clear, practical advice focused on your business goals.</span></span></span></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Proven Experience</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"> &ndash; Our team of lawyers help to handle legal disputes for businesses of all sizes.</span></span></span></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Negotiation &amp; Mediation</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"> &ndash; Whenever possible, we help you resolve matters without going to court.</span></span></span></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Court Representation</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"> &ndash; If necessary, we provide strong advocacy in all Australian courts.</span></span></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n<hr /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:13.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">Protect Your Business &ndash; Speak with Our Corporate Litigation Team</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">If you are facing any legal issue it does not have to stop or slow down your business. <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/\">Top legal firm in Melbourne Australia</a> provides you the legal support and strategy to handle the situation for your better future.

This visa aims to attract talented individuals from around the world? who can make a significant contribution to Australia economy and innovation ecosystem. As these changes take effect, there are several key aspects to consider. Lets explore the amendments and what they mean for your visa application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the National Innovation Visa?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Innovation Visa (Subclass 858) is designed to provide a pathway for skilled professionals, researchers, and entrepreneurs with internationally recognized achievements in their fields. Whether you&rsquo;re an innovator, an entrepreneur, or an expert in your profession, this visa is tailored to those who can offer a unique contribution to Australia&rsquo;s economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of the National Innovation Visa comes with a number of important amendments to the Migration Regulations, effective from 6 December 2024. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: inherit;\">Key Changes Under the National Innovation Visa (Subclass 858)</a></h2>\r\n1. Renaming and Replacing the Global Talent Visa:\r\n\r\n<p>The Migration Amendment (National Innovation Visa) Regulations 2024 officially replace references to the Global Talent Visa with the National Innovation Visa throughout the Migration Regulations 1994. This is more than just a name change; it signifies Australia&rsquo;s shift to a broader focus on national innovation and economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this transition, all references to the Global Talent Visa (Class BX) will be changed to the National Innovation Visa (Class BX). For example, in Schedule 1 of the Migration Regulations, the term &ldquo;Global Talent&rdquo; will be substituted with &ldquo;National Innovation&rdquo; in various provisions, such as Regulation 1.12(7) and Subregulation 2.06AAB(1), along with others.</p>\r\n2. Invitation to Apply Requirement:\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant changes with the National Innovation Visa is the requirement that applicants must be invited, in writing, by the Minister to apply. This was not a requirement under the previous Global Talent Visa system, but it is now a key step for individuals wishing to apply for the National Innovation Visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants will need to apply within the period stated in the invitation and meet the criteria outlined in the invitation. This ensures that only those with a specific invitation from the Minister will be eligible to submit their application.</p>\r\n3. Record of Exceptional and Outstanding Achievement: Under the new regulations, applicants must demonstrate that their internationally recognized record of exceptional and outstanding achievements aligns with the details provided in the invitation. This includes showing their achievements in the specific area stated in the invitation, which could be in sectors like technology, business, research, or other fields of national importance. This requirement is codified in Clause 858.212(3) of Schedule 2, which ensures that the applicant&rsquo;s achievements are directly aligned with the ministerial invitation. 4. Transitional Arrangements:\r\n\r\n<p>For applicants who have already lodged a Global Talent Visa application before 6 December 2024, their application will continue to be assessed under the old Global Talent visa rules. The new regulations only apply to applications submitted after 6 December 2024, ensuring a clear transition for those in the process before the changes come into effect.</p>\r\n5. Streamlined Application Process:\r\n\r\n<p>From 6 December 2024, applicants must submit their applications using Form 47NI. This form can be completed online through Immi Account or submitted in paper format by email, provided the Department of Home Affairs authorizes this method. It&rsquo;s essential to ensure the correct form is used and the application is submitted within the timeframe stated in the invitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Benefits of the National Innovation Visa</h2>\r\nThe National Innovation Visa offers several significant benefits: &bull;\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pathway to Permanent Residency: The National Innovation Visa is designed to lead to permanent residency in Australia, offering long-term opportunities for individuals and their families to live, work, and contribute to Australia&rsquo;s economy.</li>\r\n	<li>&bull;</li>\r\n	<li>Attracting Global Talent: This visa will support Australia&rsquo;s ambition to attract high-quality talent, particularly in high-demand fields such as technology, research, business, and other innovative sectors.</li>\r\n	<li>&bull;</li>\r\n	<li>Simplified Process: With the repeal of endorsement requirements and a more transparent application procedure, the National Innovation Visa is set to streamline the immigration process for highly skilled professionals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What You Need to Do Now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re considering applying for the National Innovation Visa (Subclass 858) post-6 December 2024, ensure that you are invited by the Minister and that your application aligns with the details mentioned in the invitation. Meeting the strict requirements regarding your exceptional achievements is crucial for success. ?.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, make sure to submit your application through the correct channels, using Form 47NI, and within the specified timeframe mentioned in the invitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Innovation Visa is a promising new opportunity for professionals, researchers, and entrepreneurs seeking to make a lasting impact on Australia&#39;s economy and innovation landscape. If you are planning to apply or need assistance navigating these changes, Bansal Lawyers is here to provide expert legal advice and support throughout the process.

Individuals seeking to challenge decisions related to visas, immigration matters, and other migration-related issues often find themselves in need of legal guidance. One of the key legal processes for such challenges is judicial review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we specialize in providing expert advice and representation for clients facing migration decisions that they believe have involved jurisdictional errors. This article provides an overview of judicial review of migration decisions by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (the Court), including important processes and considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/exciting-changes-to-australias-administrative-review-system\">What is Judicial Review in Migration Cases?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial review is a process where a court reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a government body or administrative authority. In the case of migration decisions, this means that if you are dissatisfied with a decision related to your visa application, you may request the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia to review it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is essential to understand that the court does not review the merits of your visa application. Instead, it focuses on whether a jurisdictional error was made. A jurisdictional error occurs when the decision-maker (e.g., the Minister for Immigration or members of the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) or Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA)) has:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Failed to follow the correct legal procedures.</li>\r\n	<li>Misinterpreted or applied the law incorrectly.</li>\r\n	<li>Acted beyond their legal powers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court will only determine whether such an error occurred and will not evaluate the substance of your visa application itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What the Court Can and Cannot Do</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court has specific powers when reviewing a migration decision:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Court can:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Identify if a jurisdictional error has occurred.</li>\r\n	<li>Refer your case back to the decision-maker (such as the Minister or ART) for reconsideration.</li>\r\n	<li>Prevent the Minister from acting on a flawed decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Court cannot:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reconsider the facts of your visa application.</li>\r\n	<li>Take into account new factual information, except if it is relevant to whether a jurisdictional error occurred.</li>\r\n	<li>Grant you a visa directly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to understand that the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia will not grant a visa even if the decision was flawed, but rather it ensures that the decision-making process is lawful and follows due process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Time Limits for Filing a Judicial Review Application</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to request a judicial review of a migration decision, you must file an application within <strong>35 days</strong> of the decision date. Failing to meet this deadline could result in your application being dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need more time, you can request an extension, but you must explain why you were unable to meet the original time frame. The Court will then decide whether to grant an extension based on your circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Process of Applying for Judicial Review</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To initiate judicial review, you must complete an application and an affidavit. Your application should clearly identify the jurisdictional error that you believe occurred in the decision-making process. The affidavit should detail the facts and circumstances surrounding the error and include the decision to be reviewed, as well as any statement of reasons for the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your application is filed, you must serve a copy of the application and supporting documents to the Minister (or the relevant decision-making body) within a specific time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Court Hearings and Your Role</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your application is filed and served, the Court will allocate a hearing date. The hearing allows both parties&mdash;the applicant (you) and the Minister&#39;s legal representative&mdash;to present arguments regarding the alleged jurisdictional error. It&rsquo;s important to note that unless excused, you must attend the hearing, as failure to do so may lead to your case being dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, the Court may decide that you have not shown an arguable case and may dismiss your application before the final hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Legal Costs and Fees</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing a judicial review application comes with associated costs. You will need to pay a fee when you submit your application and another fee if the case goes to a final hearing. There are exceptions, such as if you are in financial hardship or hold certain government concession cards. For more details about fees, contact the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia or visit their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the unsuccessful party typically must pay the legal costs of the successful party. If you withdraw your case, you may also be required to cover some of the costs incurred by the other party.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Confidentiality and Protection Visas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In some instances, court hearings may be closed to the public, particularly when sensitive matters, such as protection visas, are involved. In these cases, the Court is also prohibited from publishing your identity to protect your privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When to Seek Legal Advice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial review is a highly technical process that requires a solid understanding of legal procedures. At Bansal Lawyers, we strongly recommend seeking professional legal advice if you are considering judicial review for your visa decision. Our experienced migration lawyers can assess your case, help you understand whether there has been a jurisdictional error, and guide you through the application and hearing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In complex migration matters, the right legal advice can make all the difference. We provide tailored support to ensure that you understand your options and the legal steps you need to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Contact Bansal Lawyers for Assistance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you believe that a migration decision has been made unlawfully or improperly and you are considering judicial review, Bansal Lawyers is here to assist you.

(6, 'Key Changes to Student Visa Processing Under the Latest Ministerial Direction', 'important-changes-to-student-visa-processing-ministerial-direction', 1, '<div class=\"container\">\r\n<h2>Important Changes to Student Visa Processing: Ministerial Direction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian Government has updated the student visa processing system with the revocation of Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107) and the introduction of Ministerial Direction 111 (MD111), effective December 19, 2024. These changes aim to streamline and ensure fair and efficient processing of Student visas in response to the growing international education sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Revocation of Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As of December 18, 2024, MD107 was revoked. Initially, MD107 was introduced to manage the increasing volume of student visa applications, prioritizing providers with strong recruitment practices. However, it became apparent that it disproportionately affected certain education providers. The government recognized the need for a more balanced approach, leading to the replacement of MD107 with MD111.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/visa-refusal-australia-review-appeal-bansal-lawyers\">Introduction of Ministerial Direction 111</a> (MD111)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MD111 establishes new guidelines for processing offshore Subclass 500 (Student) visa applications. It aims to ensure more equitable processing across different provider types and locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Aspects of MD111</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Priority Categories for Visa Processing:</strong>\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li><strong>Priority 1 &ndash; High:</strong> Offshore Student visa applications linked to providers in the higher education and vocational education sectors, who have not yet reached their prioritization threshold, will receive fast-tracked processing. These providers must remain within 80% of their indicative allocation of new overseas student commencements for 2025.</li>\r\n		<li><strong>Priority 2 &ndash; Standard:</strong> Once a provider meets the prioritization threshold, applications linked to that provider will be processed at the standard rate.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Impact on Different Sectors:</strong> MD111 also applies to other sectors, including schools, higher degree research students, scholarship recipients, and students from regions like the Pacific and Timor-Leste, ensuring priority processing for students from these areas.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Visa Processing is Not a Guarantee of Approval:</strong> While MD111 speeds up processing for Priority 1 applicants, it does not guarantee visa approval. Applications are still assessed on merit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why These Changes Matter</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The revised system ensures that smaller and regional providers are not overlooked and that students from all regions benefit from faster processing. MD111 also makes the process more transparent and predictable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What This Means for Students</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you plan to study in Australia in 2025, now is the time to submit your visa application. Ensure your application is complete and submitted early to avoid delays. MD111 prioritizes applications based on the provider&rsquo;s enrolment status, but applying early remains the best approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministerial Direction 111 is a significant step toward improving fairness and efficiency in student visa processing. Understanding the new priority system will help students navigate the process effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we understand the complexities of Australian immigration law and are dedicated to providing expert legal guidance throughout the student visa application process. With the recent changes under Ministerial Direction 111, it is more important than ever to ensure that your visa application is well-prepared and submitted on time.

This reform replaces the existing Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) system with something new, improved, and more efficient. At Bansal Lawyers, we break down these changes for you in an easy-to-understand way, so you can stay ahead of the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. New, Tougher Qualifications for Tribunal Members</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the ART Act, the qualifications for Tribunal members are getting stricter. For the first time, non-judicial deputy presidents (who play a major role in decision-making) must have 10 years of legal experience&mdash;double the requirement for many judges! Senior members and general members also need to have a solid background in law or specialized experience. This means the Tribunal now has even more experienced and qualified people making decisions that affect your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Merit-Based Appointments: No More &quot;Hand-Picked&quot; Roles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant changes is how members are selected. Instead of being appointed behind closed doors, members now go through a publicly advertised, merit-based process. This ensures that only the most qualified candidates, based on their experience and skills, are appointed. It&#39;s all about ensuring the Tribunal has the best people in the right roles, with transparency playing a key role in this reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Professional Development for Tribunal Members</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART Act emphasizes the importance of continuous learning for Tribunal members. With new responsibilities for the President and Tribunal leaders to ensure members receive proper training and professional development, the focus is on keeping the Tribunal at the cutting edge of legal expertise. This means the people making decisions in your case have up-to-date knowledge and skills, leading to better, more informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. New Terms and Reappointment Process</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the ART Act, members can only be appointed for a maximum of five years, with the chance to reapply for the role through a competitive selection process. This change ensures members remain accountable for their work. If a member is not performing well, they can be replaced, ensuring the Tribunal remains efficient and effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. More Flexible and Efficient Tribunal Structure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART Act introduces jurisdictional areas, allowing members to specialize in specific areas like Migration, Social Security, Taxation, and more. This means Tribunal members are assigned to areas where they have the most relevant expertise, ensuring cases are handled by the most knowledgeable person possible. Plus, the President has the flexibility to move members between areas as needed, enabling the Tribunal to respond quickly to changing demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Independence of Members: A Delicate Balance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the ART Act brings many improvements, one thing to watch closely is the independence of Tribunal members. The increased involvement of the Attorney-General in appointing members and the President&rsquo;s broader powers could introduce some external influence. At Bansal Lawyers, we believe it&rsquo;s important to keep an eye on these developments to ensure the Tribunal&rsquo;s independence remains intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why These Changes Matter to You</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For those navigating the administrative review system, these changes are good news. With more qualified and specialized members and a fairer, more transparent appointment process, the system is set to deliver better decisions. Whether you&rsquo;re involved in a migration case, social security dispute, or another administrative matter, you can expect decisions to be made by individuals with the right expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we always stay on top of legal reforms to ensure we provide the best advice to our clients. If you&#39;re facing a case that could be impacted by the ART Act, we can help guide you through the changes and ensure the best possible outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get Ready for a New Era of Administrative Reviews!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART Act represents a major shift in how administrative decisions are made in Australia. By focusing on qualified members, merit-based appointments, and ongoing professional development, the ART aims to deliver more effective and transparent outcomes. But it&rsquo;s important to keep a close eye on these changes to ensure fairness and independence remain at the core of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we&rsquo;re here to help you navigate this new system. Whether you&rsquo;re a client or legal professional, understanding these changes is crucial for anyone engaging with the Tribunal in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Got questions about how these changes affect you?

However, all hope is not lost. You have the option to appeal this decision to the Migration &amp; Refugee Division of the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART). This blog will guide you through the process of appealing your visa refusal and help you understand how the ART works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/difference-between-courts-and-administrative-review-tribunal\">What is the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART)?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART is an independent body that reviews decisions made by the Australian Government, including those made by the Department of Home Affairs regarding visa applications. The ART is specifically designed to ensure that decisions made by government departments are fair, transparent, and just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2024, the ART replaced the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), continuing to handle a wide range of administrative decisions, including those related to migration and refugee cases. The ART operates with the goal of providing a more efficient and accessible process for challenging decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Are Visas Refused?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Visa refusals can occur for various reasons. Understanding these reasons can help you avoid potential pitfalls:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Failure to meet eligibility criteria</li>\r\n	<li>Insufficient documentation</li>\r\n	<li>Concerns about the authenticity of the provided information</li>\r\n	<li>Health or character issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, changes in immigration policies and regulations can also impact visa decisions. Once a visa is refused, the Department of Home Affairs will provide a decision letter outlining the reasons for the refusal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does the ART Review Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART conducts what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;merits review&rdquo; of your case. This means the ART doesn&rsquo;t just look at whether the Department of Home Affairs made a legal error. Instead, it examines the entire decision afresh, considering all facts, evidence, and the law as it stands. The ART aims to ensure that decisions are fair and based on all the relevant information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Decisions Can the ART Make?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After reviewing your case, the ART can make one of the following decisions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Affirm: The ART agrees with the original decision, and it remains unchanged.</li>\r\n	<li>Vary: The ART makes changes to the original decision.</li>\r\n	<li>Set aside: The ART agrees the original decision was wrong and makes a new decision.</li>\r\n	<li>Remit: The ART sends the case back to the Department of Home Affairs with instructions to reconsider the decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Long Do I Have to Lodge an Appeal?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART has strict timelines for lodging an appeal, typically 28 days from the date the decision was made. The exact timeline will be specified in the refusal decision letter from the Department of Home Affairs. It&#39;s crucial to submit your appeal within this time to avoid your case being dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Costs of Appealing to the ART</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most ART applications require an upfront application fee, which is currently $3,496. However, applicants who are experiencing financial hardship may be eligible for a 50% fee reduction. Additionally, if your appeal is successful, you may be refunded part of the application fee. For protection visa reviews, no upfront fee is required, but a fee of $2,151 applies if the appeal is unsuccessful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also consider the cost of legal representation if you choose to work with a lawyer to assist with your appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Long Does It Take to Get a Hearing at the ART?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While processing times can vary, the ART typically takes several months to schedule a hearing. For example, cases related to bridging visas may be finalised in around 11 days, while protection visas can take up to 2,249 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to be patient, but also proactive in preparing your case to ensure the best possible outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do I Need Legal Assistance?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&#39;s not mandatory to hire a lawyer for an ART appeal, working with an experienced immigration lawyer can significantly improve your chances of success. Legal professionals can help:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Assess your prospects of success by reviewing the refusal reasons and available evidence.</li>\r\n	<li>Gather evidence such as documents, statutory declarations, and expert opinions.</li>\r\n	<li>Prepare compelling arguments to address the reasons for refusal and ensure the strongest aspects of your case are highlighted.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to Expect at the ART Hearing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART hearing is typically less formal than court proceedings. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Where are hearings held?</strong><br />\r\n	Hearings may take place in person, via video conference, or by phone, depending on the specifics of your case.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>How long will the hearing last?</strong><br />\r\n	Hearings can last anywhere from a few minutes to several days, depending on the complexity of the case.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Who will be at the hearing?</strong>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>The ART Member who will question you and make the final decision</li>\r\n		<li>A hearing attendant to manage formalities</li>\r\n		<li>An interpreter if required</li>\r\n		<li>Your legal representative (if you have one)</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Happens After the Decision?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the ART has reviewed your case, they will issue a decision. If the decision is in your favour, the Department of Home Affairs will continue processing your visa application. If the decision is not favourable, the ART may affirm the original decision, or you may be able to appeal further to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need Help with Your Appeal?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART appeal process can be complex, but with the right legal assistance, you can improve your chances of a successful outcome.

However, in Australia, there are two primary ways to review government decisions: the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) and the Courts. While both can review decisions made by government agencies, they serve very different purposes and have different approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lets break down how these two bodies work and how they differ so that you can make informed decisions about the best path to take when challenging a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART)?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ART (formerly known as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or AAT) is responsible for merits review of decisions made by government departments, including the Department of Home Affairs. Merits review means the ART looks at the decision afresh&mdash;it does not focus on whether the decision-maker followed the law but instead focuses on the facts of the case, the law, and any new evidence. The ART&rsquo;s goal is to determine the right outcome based on all available information.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"highlight\">\r\n<p>The ART can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Affirm the decision:</strong> Agree with the original decision and leave it unchanged.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Vary the decision:</strong> Modify the original decision.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Set aside the decision:</strong> Reject the original decision and make a new one.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Remit the decision:</strong> Send the matter back to the original decision-maker, like the Department of Home Affairs, for reconsideration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re unhappy with the ART&rsquo;s decision, you can appeal to the courts for a judicial review, which looks at the legal aspects of the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Do the Courts Review Decisions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the ART&rsquo;s approach, the courts conduct judicial review, which is concerned only with the legality of the decision-making process. Courts do not reassess whether the decision itself was right or wrong; they focus on whether the decision was made according to the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the court finds that the decision was not made legally&mdash;for example, if the law was misapplied or the process was flawed&mdash;it may send the case back to the ART for reconsideration. However, the court does not change the decision directly; it simply ensures that the right legal principles are followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the court finds that the decision-making process was legal, it will dismiss the application, meaning the original decision stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Differences Between ART and the Courts</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Aspect</th>\r\n			<th>ART (Administrative Review Tribunal)</th>\r\n			<th>Courts</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Type of Review</td>\r\n			<td>Merits review (reassesses the decision from scratch)</td>\r\n			<td>Judicial review (checks if the law was applied correctly)</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Focus</td>\r\n			<td>The rightness of the decision based on facts and evidence</td>\r\n			<td>The legality of the decision-making process</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Outcome</td>\r\n			<td>Can affirm, vary, set aside, or remit the decision</td>\r\n			<td>Can remit the case or dismiss the application</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>New Evidence</td>\r\n			<td>Can consider new evidence and facts</td>\r\n			<td>Does not consider new evidence, focuses on the law</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Purpose</td>\r\n			<td>Ensures fairness and accountability in government decisions</td>\r\n			<td>Ensures decisions are made according to the law</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/divorce-laws-india-vs-australia\">Why Are Both the ART and Courts Important</a>?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the ART and the courts play vital roles in ensuring that government decisions are fair and follow the law. The ART offers a flexible, accessible review process where decisions can be re-evaluated with fresh evidence. On the other hand, the courts act as a safeguard, making sure that all decisions are legally sound and that no one, not even government bodies, is above the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When Should You Seek ART Review or Court Action?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Choose the ART:</strong> If you believe the original decision by the Department of Home Affairs was incorrect, and you have new evidence or facts that could change the outcome, the ART is the right place to review the decision.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Choose the Courts:</strong> If you believe the decision-making process itself was flawed, such as the Department of Home Affairs or the ART misapplying the law, then you can seek a judicial review in the courts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"cta\">\r\n<p><strong>Get Legal Guidance from Bansal Lawyers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the ART and judicial review processes are crucial for ensuring that administrative decisions are fair and legal.

How to Appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART)</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/visa-refusal-australia-review-appeal-bansal-lawyers\">What is the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART)?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) is an independent body created to review decisions made by Australian government agencies, including the Department of Home Affairs. Its primary role is to ensure decisions, particularly in migration and refugee matters, are fair, transparent, and legally sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously known as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the ART came into operation on <strong>14 October 2024</strong>, with a goal of improving efficiency, accessibility, and the speed of reviews, especially for migration-related matters like visa refusals or cancellations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does ART Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike courts that focus on legal interpretations, ART is more flexible, re-examining the facts of your case from the beginning. It gives you the opportunity to present new evidence, which might not have been considered in the original decision-making process. The ART does not decide whether the law was correctly applied; instead, it reassesses the decision based on available facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/difference-between-courts-and-administrative-review-tribunal\">What Is an ART Appeal?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An ART appeal allows you to challenge a government decision, such as a visa refusal or cancellation, that you believe is wrong. The process offers a chance to submit new evidence, make your case, and request a review of the original decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Apply for an ART Appeal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of applying for an appeal is straightforward but needs attention to detail. Here are the basic steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Lodging Your Application:</strong> Submit your application for review to ART.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Document Review:</strong> ART will examine your application and supporting documents.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Hearing:</strong> In some cases, a hearing is scheduled where you can present your case, and potentially call witnesses or have a lawyer represent you.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Final Decision:</strong> After reviewing your case, ART will make its decision.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this process, you may be asked for more information, and you&rsquo;ll be invited to attend a hearing, where you can present your arguments. To make the most of this opportunity, having an experienced immigration lawyer is highly recommended.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Time Limits for ART Appeals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time is critical!</strong> You must submit your appeal within <strong>28 days</strong> from the date you are notified of the decision. However, special cases, such as those under sections 501 and 501CA of the Migration Act, have different timeframes. It&rsquo;s essential to seek professional advice to avoid missing important deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Possible ART Decisions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ART has the power to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Affirm the original decision:</strong> Keep the decision as is.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Vary the decision:</strong> Modify the original decision.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Set aside the decision:</strong> Cancel the original decision and replace it with a new one.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Remit the decision:</strong> Send the matter back to the original decision-maker for reconsideration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These options provide a real opportunity to reverse or change a decision in your favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why You Should Have an Immigration Lawyer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigating the ART appeal process can be complex, but with the help of a skilled immigration lawyer, you can significantly improve your chances of success. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Expert Guidance:</strong> Immigration lawyers understand the intricacies of Australian migration law and can help you present your best case.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Strategic Advice:</strong> They will guide you on the best strategies and alternative migration pathways.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Document Preparation:</strong> Lawyers ensure that all paperwork is submitted correctly and in compliance with the law.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Complex Cases:</strong> Whether your case is straightforward or complicated, a lawyer&rsquo;s experience can make all the difference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Costs of ART Appeals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While pursuing an ART appeal does come with some costs, they are manageable. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Professional Fees:</strong> Legal fees vary based on the complexity of your case.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ART Application Fees:</strong> ART charges an application fee of $3496 (excluding bridging visa reviews). This must be paid upfront and may vary depending on the nature of your application.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Seek Legal Help with Your Visa Appeal?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Appealing a visa decision is a serious matter that could impact your future in Australia.

While they all serve to present evidence, they each have unique roles in the legal system. At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we&rsquo;re here to simplify these terms and guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<!-- Section 1: Affidavit -->\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Affidavit: A Sworn Statement of Fact</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An <strong>affidavit</strong> is a written declaration of facts that the person (known as the <strong>deponent</strong>) swears or affirms to be true in the presence of an authorised witness, such as a <strong>Justice of the Peace (JP)</strong>, <strong>lawyer</strong>, <strong>notary public</strong>, or <strong>police officer</strong>. It is a formal document often used in legal proceedings as a substitute for oral testimony. If the affidavit is accepted by the court and not challenged, it can serve as the witness&rsquo;s <strong>official testimony</strong> without the need for live appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Common Uses:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Family law matters (e.g., custody, divorce proceedings)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Civil litigation</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Probate and estate matters</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Immigration and visa applications</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How to Make an Affidavit:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Draft the Statement</strong>: Clearly write the facts you want to declare. Use numbered paragraphs to make the document easy to read and reference.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Find an Authorised Witness</strong>: This could be a JP, solicitor, police officer, or another person qualified under the relevant state or federal law.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Sign It Yet</strong>: Only sign the affidavit in the <strong>presence of the witness</strong>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Take an Oath or Affirmation</strong>: Depending on your beliefs, you will either swear (religious) or affirm (non-religious) that the contents are true.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Sign in Front of the Witness</strong>: The witness will also sign and certify the affidavit.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Making a false affidavit is a <strong>serious offence</strong> and may result in fines, imprisonment, or charges of perjury.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><strong>2. Statutory Declaration: A Legal Declaration Outside Court</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>statutory declaration</strong> is a written statement that a person solemnly declares to be true, used in <strong>non-judicial</strong> contexts where there is a legal need to affirm the accuracy of information. Although it is not used in court proceedings, it is still a <strong>legally binding document</strong>, and false declarations can attract penalties under <strong>state or federal legislation</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Common Uses:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Confirming identity or address</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Declaring the loss of official documents</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Statements for insurance claims</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Confirming personal details for visa or government forms</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How to Make a Statutory Declaration:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Obtain the Correct Form</strong>: Different forms may be required depending on the jurisdiction (e.g., Commonwealth vs State).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Complete the Declaration</strong>: Include your full name, address, and the statement you are declaring to be true.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Do Not Sign Yet</strong>: Wait until you are with an authorised witness.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Swear or Affirm in Front of a Witness</strong>: Like with an affidavit, you will either swear or affirm the statement.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Sign in the Presence of the Witness</strong>: The witness must watch you sign and then sign and date the declaration themselves.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Penalties</strong> for false declarations may include <strong>fines or imprisonment</strong> under the <strong>Statutory Declarations Act 1959</strong> (for Commonwealth declarations) or relevant state laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><strong>3. Statement of Evidence: A Signed Account of Testimony</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>statement of evidence</strong> (also known as a <strong>witness statement</strong>) is a document that records a witness&rsquo;s <strong>account of events</strong> relevant to a legal matter. Unlike an affidavit or statutory declaration, it is <strong>not sworn or affirmed</strong>, but it is still signed and dated by the witness. The person who provides the statement can be called to court to <strong>verify the truth</strong> of the content under oath during trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Common Uses:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Civil litigation or tribunal matters</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Personal injury claims</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Workplace investigations</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Criminal cases (preliminary witness interviews)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Key Features:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It includes a <strong>detailed narrative</strong> of what the witness saw, heard, or experienced.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The document should be <strong>clear, factual</strong>, and free of speculation or opinion unless specifically relevant.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It is generally prepared <strong>by the witness</strong>, or with the help of a lawyer or investigator.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The witness must be ready to <strong>attend court and testify</strong>, confirming the accuracy of the statement.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike affidavits, <strong>witness statements are not automatically admissible</strong> as evidence unless verified in court. However, they are crucial tools in <strong>trial preparation</strong> and <strong>disclosure</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you make a false statement in an affidavit or statutory declaration, it&rsquo;s a criminal offense and can result in serious penalties, including imprisonment.</p>\r\n<!-- Conclusion -->\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the difference between these legal documents is key for anyone involved in legal matters.

Whether you are in a marriage or a de facto relationship, understanding the differences is crucial, especially when it comes to property settlements, financial agreements, and rights following separation. At Bansal Lawyers, we provide expert guidance to help you navigate these complexities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/step-by-step-guide-applying-divorce-in-australia\">The Definition of Marriage vs. De Facto Relationship</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, marriage is a formal and legal union between two people, entered into voluntarily for life. Once married, the law automatically recognizes the relationship, and your marriage certificate is proof of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A de facto relationship is when two people live together and share a domestic life, but are not married or related. Unlike marriage, a de facto relationship doesn&rsquo;t have the same official recognition, which can make legal matters more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Proving a Marriage vs. Proving a De Facto Relationship</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Proving you are married is relatively straightforward&mdash;simply present your marriage certificate. However, proving that you are in a de facto relationship is more complicated. To make financial claims after the breakdown of a de facto relationship, you must demonstrate that you and your partner lived together or maintained a domestic relationship for a minimum of two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence to support the existence of a de facto relationship can include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Joint property ownership or lease agreements</li>\r\n	<li>Joint bank accounts</li>\r\n	<li>Household bills in both names</li>\r\n	<li>Mail addressed to both parties at the same address</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you can bypass the two-year rule if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You have registered the relationship</li>\r\n	<li>You share a child together</li>\r\n	<li>One partner has made a substantial financial contribution to the relationship</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do De Facto Couples Have the Same Legal Rights as Married Couples?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Family Law Act, de facto couples are afforded the same legal rights as married couples when it comes to property settlements, financial settlements, and spousal maintenance, regardless of whether the relationship is heterosexual or same-sex. However, it&#39;s important to note that some couples may still have rights under older state-based de facto relationship laws if they separated before the Commonwealth took over jurisdiction under the Family Law Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure about your rights, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to consult with an experienced family lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/how-to-divide-finances-and-property-after-separation-australia\">Marriage vs. De Facto Relationship: What to Consider</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Marriage is indisputable. Once you&rsquo;ve had a valid marriage ceremony, the law immediately recognizes your union. This can provide significant legal advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Power of Attorney:</strong> If your spouse becomes incapacitated, you may more easily be granted Power of Attorney over their finances and legal affairs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> If your spouse passes away without a will, you may automatically be entitled to part or all of their estate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In a de facto relationship, these legal benefits may not automatically apply. For example, if your partner dies without a will, you may not be entitled to their estate unless you&rsquo;ve taken specific steps to establish your legal standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Protect Yourself in a De Facto Relationship</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you choose not to marry, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself legally in a de facto relationship:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Register the Relationship:</strong> This can make your relationship legally recognized and can help secure many of the same rights as a married couple.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Draw Up a Financial Agreement:</strong> A financial agreement outlines how property and finances will be handled in the event of a separation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Include Each Other in Estate Planning:</strong> Have a will that specifies how your estates will be administered and distributed, and nominate each other as beneficiaries for superannuation funds, life insurance, and other investments.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are in a marriage or a de facto relationship, the law recognizes both types of unions, but they come with distinct legal definitions and requirements. While the legal rights for de facto couples have been aligned with those of married couples in many areas, the process of proving the relationship and securing legal benefits can be more complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we are here to assist you in understanding and managing the complexities of family law, whether you are married, in a de facto relationship, or considering a separation. If you&rsquo;re unsure about your rights or need assistance with a financial agreement, property settlement, or other family law matters, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to us for expert advice and representation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact Bansal Lawyers today</strong> to discuss your situation and ensure you have the right legal protection for your relationship.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- Full Blog Content -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mt-5 row\" id=\"blog-content\" style=\"display:none\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<div class=\"bg-dark p-4 text-white\" style=\"border-radius:5px\">\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Explore the legal distinctions between de facto relationships and marriage in Australia.

What makes this process even more challenging is that divorce laws vary significantly from country to country. Whether you are in India or Australia, the divorce process comes with its own set of rules, procedures, and requirements. In this blog, we will explore the key differences between the divorce processes in India and Australia, so you can better understand what to expect if you are going through or considering a divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we are dedicated to offering expert guidance through the <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/hiding-assets-during-divorce-australia\">divorce process in Australia</a>, helping you navigate the legal landscape with confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Fault vs. No-Fault Divorce: What&#39;s the Difference?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant differences between the divorce processes in India and Australia is how &quot;fault&quot; is treated. In Australia, the concept of fault is not considered when it comes to divorce. The law simply requires that the marriage has irretrievably broken down, usually evidenced by 12 months of separation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, India has different rules depending on the couple&#39;s religion. For example, under the Hindu Marriage Act, grounds like cruelty, adultery, and desertion can be used as &quot;fault&quot; grounds to seek a divorce. So, if you&#39;re in India, proving fault may be a part of your divorce process if you are not pursuing a mutual consent divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Religion and Divorce: A Key Factor in India</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, divorce laws are influenced by the couple&#39;s religion, which means that the legal process and grounds for divorce can vary greatly. Hindu couples follow the Hindu Marriage Act, while Muslims adhere to the Muslim Personal Law, and Christians fall under the Indian Divorce Act. This can lead to differences in divorce grounds, court procedures, and even the ability to remarry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, divorce laws are secular and apply equally to all citizens, regardless of religion. The family court system is uniform, offering a more straightforward approach for all parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Child Custody and Support: Flexibility Matters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to child custody and support, Australia offers a more flexible system that places the child&#39;s best interests at the heart of the decision. Courts work to ensure that both parents maintain an active role in the child&#39;s life, and custody arrangements are more adaptable to the family&#39;s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, while child welfare is also a priority, there can be more rigid expectations, especially regarding the custody of children. Traditionally, mothers are more likely to be awarded custody, though this is not a guarantee. Child support and maintenance laws in India can also be more rigid compared to Australia, where there is a well-established system for determining child support obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Mutual Consent Divorce: The Fast Track Option</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If both parties agree to end their marriage, a mutual consent divorce is often the quickest and easiest way to proceed. In India, this option allows couples to jointly file for divorce and settle issues like child custody, maintenance, and property division. This process usually takes 6 months to a year to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, the process is also streamlined if both parties agree. Couples can file a joint application for divorce after being separated for at least 12 months, making it a relatively quick and simple process, especially for those with no contested issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Separation Requirements: How Long Must You Be Apart?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, you must be separated for at least 12 months before applying for a divorce, and during this time, both parties must live apart. There&#39;s no need to prove fault or specific reasons for the breakdown of the marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, for a mutual consent divorce, couples must be separated for at least two years. If a divorce is being sought on fault grounds (such as cruelty or adultery), the separation period might not apply, but the case must still be presented in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Jurisdiction: <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/how-to-divide-finances-and-property-after-separation-australia\">Where Can You File for Divorce?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, divorce jurisdiction is clear-cut. To file for divorce, at least one party must either be an Australian citizen, have lived in Australia for at least 12 months, or consider Australia their home. This means even if you were married overseas, you could still apply for divorce in Australia if you meet these criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, the jurisdiction for divorce is typically determined by where the couple resides or where the marriage took place. If you&#39;re living in a foreign country, you may still be able to file for divorce in India, depending on your specific circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Six Stages of Divorce in India</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Filing the Petition:</strong> One spouse files the divorce petition, citing the reasons for the dissolution of the marriage.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Service of Summons:</strong> The other party is formally notified and required to respond.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Response:</strong> The spouse receiving the petition can either agree to the divorce or contest it.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Trial:</strong> If contested, the case goes to trial, where both parties present their evidence and arguments.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Interim Orders:</strong> Temporary orders may be requested for child custody, spousal support, or maintenance.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Final Order:</strong> Once all issues are resolved, the court issues a final decree, officially ending the marriage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/contact\">How Bansal Lawyers Can Help You Navigate Divorce in Australia</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Divorce is a challenging and emotional process, but with the right support, it can be less overwhelming.

(16, 'Top 8 Legal Risks for Small Businesses: How Bansal Lawyers Can Help', 'top-legal-risks-for-small-businesses', 1, '<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"row\" id=\"blog-list\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\"><!-- Blog Title -->\r\n<p>Starting a small business comes with many challenges, and legal issues are among the most common. From tax complications to protecting intellectual property, business owners must navigate a range of legal matters to ensure success. At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we help small businesses avoid these pitfalls. Here are the top legal risks to watch out for and how we can assist you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Incorrect Tax Declarations</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Tax laws in Australia are intricate and constantly evolving, making it easy for business owners to make mistakes in their declarations. Even unintentional errors can result in significant financial penalties, interest charges, and audits by the ATO (Australian Taxation Office). At Bansal Lawyers, we work in tandem with experienced accountants and tax advisors to ensure your business remains fully compliant. From BAS lodgments to GST reporting and end-of-year tax filings, our legal insight helps minimise risks and ensures your records meet legal and regulatory standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Unsatisfied Customers</h2>\r\n<p>A single dissatisfied customer can significantly damage your brand&rsquo;s reputation through social media or online review platforms. If the matter escalates to legal threats or formal complaints, it&rsquo;s critical to have experienced legal support. We offer strategic litigation and dispute resolution services that aim for early, amicable settlements where possible, reducing cost and stress. Our legal team can help draft clear customer service terms, return policies, and disclaimers to proactively protect your business from consumer disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Licenses and Permits</h2>\r\n<p>Every business must operate within a framework of legal permissions and industry-specific licenses. Whether it&rsquo;s a caf&eacute; needing a food handling permit, a retail store requiring signage approval, or a builder needing construction licenses, failure to secure the correct documentation can lead to fines, forced shutdowns, or legal action. Bansal Lawyers guides clients through the application, renewal, and compliance process to help you operate legally and with confidence, avoiding costly bureaucratic delays.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Employment Law</h2>\r\n<p>Hiring staff comes with numerous legal responsibilities. Without well-drafted employment contracts, workplace policies, and fair termination procedures, businesses expose themselves to claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination, or wage disputes. Our team assists employers in preparing watertight legal documents including employment contracts, non-compete clauses, workplace conduct policies, and contractor agreements. We ensure your workplace complies with the Fair Work Act and National Employment Standards (NES), protecting both employer and employee rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Intellectual Property (IP) Protection</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Your brand identity, unique products, and proprietary content are valuable business assets that must be protected. Without proper IP registration, you risk competitors copying or exploiting your work. At Bansal Lawyers, we provide end-to-end assistance in securing your trademarks, designs, trade secrets, and copyrights. Whether you&#39;re launching a new logo, software, or innovative product, we help enforce your IP rights and represent you in infringement disputes, both in Australia and internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Choosing the Right Business Structure</h2>\r\n<p>Choosing between a sole trader, partnership, trust, or company structure has lasting implications for taxation, liability, and growth potential. We assess your business goals, risk exposure, and financial forecast to recommend the most effective legal structure. For established businesses, we also assist with restructuring, merging entities, or transitioning to a company model as you expand. Our goal is to ensure your business structure supports your long-term success while remaining compliant with all regulatory obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Raising Capital</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Seeking funding from investors or venture capital firms requires precision, transparency, and legal compliance. Poorly drafted agreements or failing to meet legal disclosure obligations can deter investors and lead to disputes. Bansal Lawyers assists in preparing shareholder agreements, convertible notes, fundraising documents, and ASIC-compliant disclosures. We help businesses navigate legal complexities while attracting the right investors and safeguarding your interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Managing a Website</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In the digital age, every business website must comply with Australian Consumer Law, Privacy Act, and, where applicable, international regulations like the GDPR. Running a website without proper legal documents such as privacy policies, cookie notices, terms and conditions, or refund policies exposes you to legal risks. We draft tailored website legal documentation and ensure your online presence aligns with consumer rights, copyright regulations, data collection laws, and cyber security standards. Whether you run an e-commerce platform or a service-based website, we help you operate ethically and lawfully online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Legal challenges are inevitable, but with the right advice, they can be managed effectively.

If you find yourself in this situation, its crucial to understand what this notice entails, the potential grounds for visa cancellation, and what actions you can take to protect your visa status. At Bansal Lawyers, we specialize in guiding clients through the complexities of immigration law, particularly when facing the possibility of a visa cancellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation (NOICC)?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A NOICC is issued by the Department of Home Affairs to notify a visa holder that there are grounds for canceling their visa under the <strong>Migration Act 1958</strong>. The notice provides the visa holder with an opportunity to respond before a final decision on cancellation is made. This response typically includes presenting evidence or comments that argue against the cancellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Grounds for Visa Cancellation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several scenarios where a NOICC may be issued, and they fall under a range of reasons defined by the Migration Act. Here are some common grounds for cancellation:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Provision of Incorrect Information:</strong> Providing false or misleading information when applying for or during the course of holding a visa.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>False or Bogus Documents:</strong> Submitting fraudulent documents that are intended to deceive the Department of Home Affairs.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Visa Condition Breaches:</strong> Not adhering to the visa conditions, such as staying beyond the permitted duration or working illegally.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Failure of Business Skills Visa Holders:</strong> Not establishing or managing a business as required for certain business visas.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Character Concerns:</strong> The visa holder may pose a risk to the Australian community, possibly due to criminal activity or behavior that conflicts with Australian values.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Non-Compliance with Student Visa Conditions:</strong> Failing to meet the academic or attendance requirements set for student visa holders.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Failure to Meet Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) Visa Conditions:</strong> Not meeting the work conditions, such as not commencing employment within six months or failing to complete the required two years of employment.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Change in Circumstances:</strong> If the circumstances that originally justified the granting of the visa no longer exist.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt&#39;s important to note that the power to cancel a visa is discretionary, meaning the Department can choose not to cancel the visa even if grounds for cancellation exist. However, in certain cases, such as failure to comply with mandatory conditions, the Department must cancel the visa.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/understanding-administrative-law-bansal-lawyers\">What to Do if You Receive a NOICC</a></h2>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Receiving a NOICC means the Department of Home Affairs is considering canceling your visa. However, this doesn&#39;t mean the decision is final. You typically have five working days from receiving the notice to submit a response and present your case.</p>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h3>Steps to Take:</h3>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Understand the Grounds:</strong> Review the reasons outlined for the cancellation carefully. It&#39;s important to determine whether they are valid or whether there has been a misunderstanding.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Prepare Your Response:</strong> You must respond in writing, usually within five working days, providing arguments and supporting evidence as to why your visa should not be canceled. This can include documentation, statements, or any other relevant material.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Consider the Impact:</strong> When preparing your response, the Department will consider various factors, including: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>The purpose of your stay in Australia</li>\r\n		<li>Your compliance with visa conditions</li>\r\n		<li>Any hardship the cancellation may cause to you or your family</li>\r\n		<li>Your behavior towards the Department, past and present</li>\r\n		<li>Whether there are any international obligations that may affect the cancellation decision&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> Navigating the response process can be complicated.

This means you will lose your right to stay in the country and may face detention and deportation unless you:</p>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apply for a new visa</li>\r\n	<li>Successfully appeal the cancellation decision through a tribunal or judicial review</li>\r\n	<li>Leave Australia voluntarily&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn some cases, if the cancellation is successful and you are an unlawful non-citizen, your chances of securing a new visa to return to Australia can be severely limited, especially if the cancellation was due to serious breaches.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n<h2>Get Professional Guidance with Bansal Lawyers</h2>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we understand how distressing a NOICC can be.

Thats where a Power of Attorney (POA) comes in a legal document that allows you to appoint someone (your Attorney) to make decisions on your behalf, should you become unable to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we simplify the process to give you peace of mind, ensuring that your legal needs are handled with expertise and care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is a Power of Attorney?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A Power of Attorney gives someone the authority to manage your affairs in situations where you cannot. You decide who your Attorney is and what decisions they can make&mdash;whether for healthcare, finances, or personal matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, a Power of Attorney (POA) is a powerful legal document that allows you to appoint a trusted individual (or multiple people) to make decisions on your behalf. Choosing the right type of POA depends on your circumstances, future plans, and level of trust in the person you are appointing. At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, our team of experienced legal professionals helps clients across Melbourne understand and draft Powers of Attorney that offer protection, peace of mind, and legal certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Powers of Attorney: Which One is Right for You?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. General Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A General Power of Attorney is suitable for <strong>short-term or temporary circumstances</strong>, such as when you are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Travelling overseas for an extended period</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Temporarily hospitalised or unwell</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Engaged in financial matters where you need someone else to act on your behalf</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>However, it is important to know that this form of POA becomes <strong>invalid if you lose mental capacity</strong>. This means if you suffer from a serious illness or accident that impacts your decision-making ability, the General POA automatically ends. It is best used in situations where you remain mentally capable but are unavailable or prefer someone else to act temporarily.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Enduring Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA)</strong> is a more permanent and comprehensive arrangement. This document continues to be legally valid <strong>even if you lose the capacity to make decisions</strong>. It is especially helpful in cases involving:</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Progressive illnesses like dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Advanced age and age-related cognitive decline</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Long-term planning for disability or incapacity</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An Enduring POA ensures that a person you trust can continue making decisions about your <strong>financial, legal, and sometimes personal matters</strong> without requiring court intervention. It is a vital document for <strong>seniors and individuals with chronic health conditions</strong> who want to plan responsibly for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Supportive Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This lesser-known but highly valuable POA is designed specifically to <strong>support individuals with cognitive or intellectual disabilities</strong>. Unlike other types of POA, a Supportive Power of Attorney does not transfer decision-making authority.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, it enables the principal (the person making the POA) to appoint a supporter to help them:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Understand and access information</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Communicate their decisions to others</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Make informed choices about daily life or finances</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>This approach respects the autonomy of individuals living with disabilities while giving them the help they need to <strong>make decisions independently</strong>. It is a progressive and empowering legal tool.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Should You Set Up a POA?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a legally binding Power of Attorney in place, critical decisions about your <strong>health, finances, and personal care</strong> may be made by someone the court appoints&mdash;someone who may not know or honour your wishes. By setting up a POA with the help of <strong>Bansal Lawyers &ndash; Best Lawyers in Melbourne</strong>, you take proactive control over who can act on your behalf and in what capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establishing a POA is not just a legal formality&mdash;it&rsquo;s a <strong>strategic step in protecting your dignity, assets, and personal values</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does It Protect You?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Attorney can make decisions about:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><strong>Financial Matters</strong></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Attorney can step in to manage your banking, investments, superannuation, property transactions, payment of bills, and even running a business if you are unable to do so. This ensures continuity and financial stability during times of illness, incapacity, or absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><strong>Personal and Healthcare Decisions</strong></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the scope of your POA, your appointed person may be able to make decisions about your <strong>medical care, living arrangements, lifestyle preferences, and other personal choices</strong>&mdash;ensuring your comfort and care align with your values.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><strong>Specific Legal or Property Matters</strong></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You can create a POA for a <strong>limited or specific purpose</strong>, such as selling a house, handling one investment, or settling legal matters. This allows targeted and legally protected delegation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can even appoint multiple Attorneys and specify how they make decisions (together or separately).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Attorney&rsquo;s Duties: What You Should Know</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Attorneys must act in your best interests&mdash;making decisions based on your preferences and ensuring that they avoid conflicts of interest. They&rsquo;re legally bound to manage your affairs responsibly and with transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Should You Appoint?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose someone trustworthy, responsible, and willing to act on your behalf when needed. Think about their reliability, availability, and capacity for making important decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting It Up: Fast &amp; Simple</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting up a POA involves:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Choosing your Attorney and defining their powers.</li>\r\n	<li>Getting it witnessed by two independent witnesses (including one authorized professional, like a lawyer).</li>\r\n	<li>Signing the document and distributing certified copies to your Attorney and relevant institutions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"cta\">\r\n<p><strong>Why Wait?

It plays an essential role in ensuring that the actions of government institutions are transparent, accountable, and fair. Whether you are dealing with a government agency on an immigration matter, tax issue, or appeal to a tribunal, understanding administrative law is vital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we specialize in providing legal advice and support in various aspects of administrative law. Below, we outline what administrative law regulates, how it works, and how it promotes accountability in government decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/administrative-law-explained-expert-guidance-bansal-lawyers\">What Does Administrative Law Regulate?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrative law regulates the activities of the executive branch of the government. This branch includes government agencies and officials responsible for creating rules, making decisions, and enforcing laws. Specifically, administrative law focuses on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Rulemaking: The process through which government agencies create new regulations or modify existing ones.</li>\r\n	<li>Adjudication: The process by which agencies make decisions in individual cases, such as issuing fines or approving licenses.</li>\r\n	<li>Law enforcement: Ensuring compliance with government regulations and statutes, often carried out by agencies such as the police or other regulatory bodies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does Administrative Law Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrative law controls how government agencies and officials make decisions and exercise their powers. These powers are typically outlined in specific legislation and are known as &quot;statutory functions.&quot; Agencies and officials are required to act within the scope of their statutory authority when making decisions, ensuring that they follow the law, respect individual rights, and act within their legal framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its core, administrative law provides a system of checks and balances to ensure that government decisions are made in a fair, just, and accountable manner. This system helps prevent the abuse of power by government officials and institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does Administrative Law Include?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the federal level, administrative law covers a wide range of issues, including but not limited to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Immigration Law: Regulations concerning immigration status, visa applications, deportations, and refugee matters.</li>\r\n	<li>Tax Law: Rules and procedures for taxation, including audits, disputes, and tax assessments.</li>\r\n	<li>Centrelink Matters: Administrative decisions relating to welfare benefits and public assistance programs.</li>\r\n	<li>Tribunal Appeals: Appeals related to decisions made by government agencies, such as those heard by the Administrative Review Tribunals (ART), previously called Administrative Appeals Tribunals (AAT).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does Administrative Law Promote Accountability?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the primary functions of administrative law is to promote accountability in government decision-making. It ensures that government actions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Transparent: Decisions must be made publicly and be subject to review.</li>\r\n	<li>Rational: Government agencies must make decisions based on logical reasoning and established facts.</li>\r\n	<li>Fair: The processes involved in decision-making must be just and equitable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure these principles are upheld, administrative law provides several mechanisms for review, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Merits Review: Examining the substance of a government decision to determine whether it is correct or fair.</li>\r\n	<li>Ombudsman Investigations: Independent investigations into government actions and complaints, aiming to resolve disputes and address grievances.</li>\r\n	<li>Judicial Review: The court&#39;s oversight of government decisions to ensure they comply with the law.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/about\">Why Choose Bansal Lawyers?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we are committed to helping individuals and businesses navigate the complexities of administrative law.

Understanding <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/how-to-divide-finances-and-property-after-separation-australia\">Divorce Jurisdiction and Process in Australia</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, divorce is regulated by the <strong>Family Law Act 1975</strong> and administered through the <strong>Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCOA)</strong>. The court has jurisdiction to grant a divorce order once it is satisfied that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and the parties have been separated for at least 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to digital advancements, divorce applications can now be lodged <strong>online</strong> through the <strong>Commonwealth Courts Portal</strong>, making the process more convenient and efficient for applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we understand that divorce can be emotionally complex and legally overwhelming. Our team offers professional guidance and personalised support to ensure the entire process is handled smoothly and in accordance with the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>2. Your Divorce Application Options</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on your situation, you may apply for divorce in one of two ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sole Application</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Filed by one spouse without the other&rsquo;s involvement in the initial submission.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The applicant is responsible for <strong>serving the divorce papers</strong> to the other party.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Court attendance may be required</strong> if there are children under 18, to confirm suitable arrangements are in place.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Joint Application</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Filed together by both spouses.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>No need for one party to serve the application on the other.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Generally, <strong>no court appearance is necessary</strong>, even if children are involved&mdash;provided all documents are in order.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we can help determine which option suits your circumstances and ensure the application is completed without errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>3. Are You Eligible to Apply for Divorce?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for divorce in Australia, you must meet the following eligibility requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Residency</strong>: You or your spouse must be an Australian citizen, a permanent resident, or have lived in Australia for at least 12 months prior to filing.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage</strong>: There must be no chance of reconciliation.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Separation Period</strong>: You must be separated for at least <strong>12 months and 1 day</strong>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been living under the same roof during separation, you&rsquo;ll need to provide <strong>additional evidence</strong>, such as affidavits, to prove the separation occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>4. What Documents Do You Need?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The following documents are essential when lodging your divorce application:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Marriage Certificate</strong>: If it&rsquo;s in a foreign language, a certified English translation must be provided.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Proof of Separation (if applicable)</strong>: This is required if you and your spouse lived together during part or all of the separation period.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Counselling Certificate</strong>: Needed if you have been married less than two years, unless exempted.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We assist in ensuring all necessary documents are correctly prepared and submitted to avoid delays or rejections.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>5.

After Submitting Your Application</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the application is submitted:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The court will <strong>review your documents</strong> and may schedule a <strong>hearing</strong>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>If it&rsquo;s a sole application, <strong>you must serve documents</strong> on your spouse and provide proof of service.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>If the court is satisfied that the legal requirements have been met, it will grant a <strong>divorce order</strong>, which becomes <strong>final one month and one day after the hearing</strong>.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We will track your application, manage deadlines, and represent you if court attendance is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>7.

If you&rsquo;re facing this challenge, understanding the legal processes and your rights is crucial to ensuring a fair outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we know that these financial matters can be overwhelming, which is why we&rsquo;ve put together this guide to help you navigate the key steps involved in dividing property and resolving financial support issues after separation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/parenting-arrangements-after-divorce-in-australia\">Understanding Financial Arrangements After Separation</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When a relationship ends, several financial matters need to be addressed, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Property Division:</strong> How assets and liabilities will be split.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Debts:</strong> Who will be responsible for any outstanding debts.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Financial Support:</strong> This could be support for yourself or for children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you and your former partner can agree on how to divide everything, you can formalise it through Consent Orders or a Financial Agreement. This process can save you time, stress, and money by avoiding the need for court involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you can&rsquo;t agree, don&rsquo;t worry! There are alternative solutions like mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that can help you reach a fair agreement without the need to go to court. If all else fails, you can apply to the Family Court to make a final decision on how to divide the property and any financial support obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Divorce vs. Financial Proceedings: Two Separate Processes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that divorce and financial proceedings are separate legal processes. Even if your divorce isn&rsquo;t finalised, you can still apply to the court for financial orders. Likewise, you can seek property or maintenance orders before your divorce is final.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Financial Support After Separation</h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Spousal Maintenance:</strong> If one partner needs financial support after separation, they can apply for spousal maintenance. This applies to both married and de facto relationships.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Child Support:</strong> Parents have a legal obligation to support their children financially after separation. You can apply for child support or child maintenance orders to ensure your children&rsquo;s needs are met.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>How the Court Makes Financial Decisions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your case goes to court, the judge doesn&rsquo;t use a fixed formula to divide assets or determine maintenance. Instead, the court considers multiple factors to ensure a &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; outcome:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Financial Contributions:</strong> This includes income, assets brought into the relationship, and inheritances.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Non-Financial Contributions:</strong> Like homemaking or caring for children.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>The Welfare of Children:</strong> The judge will also consider the needs of any children involved and each party&rsquo;s future requirements, including age, health, and financial resources.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Time Limits for Financial Applications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is crucial when it comes to financial claims after separation:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>For marriages, applications must be made within <strong>12 months</strong> of the divorce being final.</li>\r\n	<li>For de facto relationships, applications must be made within <strong>2 years</strong> from the breakdown of the relationship.</li>\r\n	<li>For null and void marriages, applications must be made within <strong>12 months</strong> of the decree of nullity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure to act promptly! Missing these deadlines could limit your ability to resolve financial matters. If you do miss the deadline, you may need to seek permission from the court, which isn&rsquo;t always guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Other Financial Considerations: Superannuation and Bankruptcy</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Superannuation:</strong> Your superannuation can be part of the property division, and you may be entitled to a share of your partner&rsquo;s superannuation, or vice versa.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> If either partner is bankrupt, it may affect how assets and debts are divided. The court can address bankruptcy in family law proceedings to ensure fairness.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why You Should Seek Legal Advice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Family law can be complicated, and understanding your rights and options is vital. While you don&rsquo;t have to hire a lawyer to apply for consent orders or start legal proceedings, having experienced legal support is highly recommended. A family lawyer can guide you through the process, help you assess your options, and ensure your interests are protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we specialise in family law and financial settlements.

As you embark on your legal journey whether you are seeking a divorce, child custody arrangement, or financial settlement. it is crucial to know what fees to expect and how they may impact your case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Bansal Lawyers, we believe in providing clarity about the legal process, so here&rsquo;s a comprehensive breakdown of the fees that you might encounter in family law proceedings in Australia, based on the Federal Government&rsquo;s <strong>Family Law (Fees) Regulations 2022</strong>. These fees are effective from <strong>1 July 2024</strong> and can help you budget appropriately for your case.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Filing Fees: The Initial Step in Family Law Proceedings</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you file a case in court, you&#39;ll need to pay a filing fee. These fees vary depending on the type of application you&#39;re submitting. Below are some of the most common fees:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Application for Divorce:</strong> $1,100</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Application for Divorce (Reduced Fee):</strong> $365 (Available if both parties meet eligibility criteria)</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Application for Consent Orders:</strong> $200</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Application for Decree as to Nullity:</strong> $1,560</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Application for Decree as to Nullity (Reduced Fee):</strong> $520</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Initiating Application (Parenting or Financial, Final Only):</strong> $425</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Initiating Application (Parenting or Financial, Final and Interim):</strong> $570</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Initiating Application (Parenting and Financial, Final Only):</strong> $695</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Initiating Application (Parenting and Financial, Final and Interim):</strong> $840</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Response to Initiating Application (Final):</strong> $425</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in a situation where financial hardship is a concern or you hold certain government concession cards, you may be eligible for reduced fees or even exemptions. Be sure to check the specific guidelines or speak with our legal team to see if you qualify.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Court Event Fees: Costs for Court Hearings and Conferences</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As your case moves forward, additional fees may apply for court events such as hearings or conciliation conferences. These fees help cover the administrative costs of organizing and conducting these proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Setting Down for Hearing Fee (Defended Matter):</strong>\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li><strong>Division 2:</strong> $770</li>\r\n		<li><strong>Division 1:</strong> $1,045</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Daily Hearing Fee (for Each Hearing Day, Excluding the First Day):</strong>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li><strong>Division 2:</strong> $770</li>\r\n		<li><strong>Division 1:</strong> $1,045</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Conciliation Conference Fee:</strong> $480</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These event fees are non-refundable once paid, so it&rsquo;s important to be prepared for these costs. If your case goes to a trial or if hearings are scheduled over multiple days, you will need to account for daily hearing fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Additional Costs: Other Court-Related Fees</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also various smaller fees for specific actions in the court process, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Interim Order Application (Parenting or Financial):</strong> $145</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Issue Subpoena:</strong> $65</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Application Under the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010:</strong> $145</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Filing an Application to Register a New Zealand Judgment:</strong> $130</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Payment Methods for Court Fees</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To make the payment process easier, family law court fees can be paid in several ways, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Online Payments:</strong> Via the Commonwealth Courts Portal for eFiling.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Eftpos, Debit or Credit Card:</strong> Directly at the court registry.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mail Payments:</strong> Using Visa or MasterCard credit/debit cards (or pre-paid debit cards available at retail outlets).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that GST does not apply to court fees, which simplifies the cost structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Reduced Fees and Exemptions for Those Facing Financial Hardship</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re facing financial hardship, you may be eligible for reduced fees or fee exemptions, particularly for divorce and decree of nullity applications. Both parties must meet eligibility requirements for a reduced fee in divorce applications filed jointly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see if you qualify for reduced fees or fee exemptions, be sure to consult the Guidelines for Reduced Fees or reach out to our legal team for further assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6.

The emotional and logistical complexities of separation can leave parents uncertain about the best way to ensure their children well-being during such a significant transition. At Bansal Lawyers, we understand that maintaining a focus on your child needs is crucial, and we are here to help you navigate the legal aspects of divorce and parenting arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Children Can Flourish After Divorce</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to recognize that children from divorced families can thrive just as well as children from intact families, especially when they are supported and encouraged to maintain positive relationships with both parents and other significant people in their lives, such as grandparents or extended family members, where it is safe to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for some children, divorce can be a stressful experience. Children&rsquo;s reactions often depend on factors like their age, temperament, and the level of conflict or cooperation between their parents. It is natural for children to experience a range of emotions during and after a divorce, and addressing these emotions with care is essential for their long-term well-being. If you or your child are feeling stressed due to the divorce, it&rsquo;s a good idea to seek support and consider helpful resources to manage these challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/guide-to-successful-co-parenting-after-divorce\">What Does a Child Need After Divorce?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After a divorce, it&rsquo;s essential to focus on your child&rsquo;s emotional and physical needs. Both parents should prioritize the following actions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reassure your child that they are loved and that the divorce is not their fault.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintain a positive and cooperative relationship with your ex-partner when it comes to making decisions about your child&rsquo;s care.</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid involving your child in conflicts, and ensure they are not caught in the middle of any disputes.</li>\r\n	<li>Encourage open communication, allowing your child to express their feelings and concerns without fear of judgment.</li>\r\n	<li>Support relationships with extended family, like grandparents, if appropriate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A child needs stability, routine, and the assurance that both parents are committed to providing care and support. By prioritizing the child&rsquo;s well-being, parents can help their children adjust to life after divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Considerations for Parenting Arrangements After Divorce</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Divorce is unique for every family, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to parenting arrangements. When determining the best arrangements for your child, there are several factors to keep in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Safety First: The safety of your child should always be the primary concern, particularly when dealing with potential issues like family violence or neglect.</li>\r\n	<li>Child&rsquo;s Wishes: Depending on their age and maturity, children may have preferences about their living arrangements or time spent with each parent. These views should be considered when making decisions.</li>\r\n	<li>Routine and Stability: Establishing a predictable routine can help children feel secure, but it&rsquo;s important to remain flexible in case of changes such as special occasions or school holidays.</li>\r\n	<li>Time with Extended Family: If possible, children should continue to spend time with extended family members such as grandparents or other important people in their lives.</li>\r\n	<li>Future Considerations: Decisions about the child&rsquo;s schooling, extracurricular activities, healthcare, and religious practices should be part of the ongoing conversation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Legal Framework: Best Interests of the Child</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Australia, the Family Law Act 1975 sets out that the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in any parenting dispute, including matters related to living arrangements, education, and healthcare decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When determining what is in the child&rsquo;s best interests, the Court will consider a variety of factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Safety: The Court will evaluate whether arrangements promote the safety of the child and anyone who has care of the child, particularly in relation to family violence or abuse.</li>\r\n	<li>Emotional, Psychological, and Cultural Needs: The child&rsquo;s emotional and psychological needs are critical, as well as their cultural identity, particularly for Indigenous children.</li>\r\n	<li>Relationship with Parents and Extended Family: The Court will also weigh the benefit of a child maintaining relationships with both parents, and where it is safe, with other significant people in the child&rsquo;s life, such as grandparents or siblings.</li>\r\n	<li>The Capacity of Parents to Meet the Child&rsquo;s Needs: The Court considers whether each parent can meet the child&rsquo;s developmental, emotional, and cultural needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If parents can reach a mutual agreement about their child&rsquo;s care, a Parenting Plan can be created. If you cannot come to an agreement, you may need to seek Parenting Orders from the Court. In some cases, the Court will appoint an Independent Children&rsquo;s Lawyer to represent the child&rsquo;s interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What If You Can&rsquo;t Agree on Parenting Arrangements?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is always preferable to resolve parenting matters amicably, it is not uncommon for parents to face challenges in reaching an agreement post-divorce. There are several ways to work through these challenges:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Informal Arrangements: Sometimes, parents can agree to informal arrangements without formal legal documentation.</li>\r\n	<li>Parenting Plans: If a more formal agreement is needed, a Parenting Plan can outline the specifics of your child&rsquo;s care.</li>\r\n	<li>Parenting Orders: If informal arrangements or a Parenting Plan are not sufficient, parents may need to apply for Parenting Orders through the Court.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, mediation or dispute resolution can help resolve disagreements without court intervention. If Court orders are needed, Bansal Lawyers can assist in navigating the process and ensuring that your child&rsquo;s best interests are protected throughout the legal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Divorce is undoubtedly difficult for both parents and children. However, with the right support and expert legal guidance, it is possible to make decisions that prioritize the well-being of your child.

But what happens if life circumstances change, and you need to leave the property before the end of the lease term? Is it possible to break the lease without penalties? At Bansal Lawyers, we are here to help you navigate these complex issues with a clear understanding of your rights and responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/why-you-need-power-of-attorney-bansal-lawyers-australia\">What Does It Mean to Break a Rental Agreement?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking a rental agreement refers to a situation where a tenant leaves the property:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Before the end of the lease term, or</li>\r\n	<li>Without providing proper notice to the landlord.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, this was commonly referred to as &quot;breaking the lease.&quot; While you may be able to leave early in some cases, doing so without following proper procedures can lead to significant financial consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Common Costs for Breaking a Lease</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you break your lease early, the landlord may incur certain costs as a result. Here are some of the common costs associated with breaking a lease:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Lost Rent:</strong> If the landlord is unable to rent out the property immediately, they may seek compensation for lost rent during the period that the property remains vacant.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Advertising Fees:</strong> The landlord may need to advertise the property to find a new tenant, and they could ask you to cover these costs if you break the lease early.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Re-letting Fees:</strong> If the landlord uses a real estate agent to find a new tenant, you might be responsible for paying a proportion of the agent&rsquo;s re-letting fee.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the good news is that you won&rsquo;t be penalized for breaking the lease, and you won&rsquo;t be required to pay the full amount of lost rent unless the landlord can prove that the costs were directly due to your early departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When Can You Leave Without Paying Fees?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, tenants can leave early without incurring additional costs. Here are some scenarios where this might apply:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Reason for Leaving Early</th>\r\n			<th>Notice Period Required</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Family Violence</td>\r\n			<td>Immediate notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Property Doesn&rsquo;t Meet Minimum Standards</td>\r\n			<td>Immediate notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Medical or Care Needs</td>\r\n			<td>14 days&rsquo; notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Moving into Social Housing</td>\r\n			<td>14 days&rsquo; notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Notice of Intent to Sell (if not disclosed before lease)</td>\r\n			<td>14 days&rsquo; notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Rental Provider Gives Notice for Major Repairs or Sale</td>\r\n			<td>14 days&rsquo; notice to vacate</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, if the rental provider decides to sell or demolish the property, you may be allowed to leave early without facing penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Disputing Costs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you believe the fees charged for breaking your lease are excessive, you can attempt to negotiate directly with the landlord or property manager. If an agreement cannot be reached, you have the right to apply to VCAT to have the fees reviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Severe Hardship: Can You Leave Without Paying?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re experiencing severe hardship, such as loss of income or a serious medical condition, you may apply to VCAT to break the lease without paying any costs. VCAT will consider your personal circumstances and decide whether the hardship justifies the early termination of your lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Bansal Lawyers Can Help</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking a lease can be stressful, especially when you&#39;re unsure of your rights.

That is where a Power of Attorney (POA) comes in a legal document that allows you to appoint someone (your Attorney) to make decisions on your behalf, should you become unable to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we simplify the process to give you peace of mind, ensuring that your legal needs are handled with expertise and care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/understanding-affidavits-statutory-declarations-statements-of-evidence\" target=\"_blank\">What is a Power of Attorney?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A Power of Attorney gives someone the authority to manage your affairs in situations where you cannot. You decide who your Attorney is and what decisions they can make&mdash;whether for healthcare, finances, or personal matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Powers of Attorney: Which One is Right for You?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. General Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>General Power of Attorney</strong> allows you to appoint someone to make <strong>financial and legal decisions</strong> on your behalf. It is best suited for <strong>short-term or temporary situations</strong> when you&#39;re:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Travelling overseas</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Recovering from an illness or surgery</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Temporarily unable to manage your affairs</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of POA gives your appointed person full authority to act on your behalf in matters such as <strong>banking, paying bills, selling property, or signing legal documents</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Enduring Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An <strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA)</strong> is designed for <strong>long-term planning</strong> and offers more security than a General POA. What makes it different is that it:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Remains legally valid <strong>even if you lose mental capacity</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Can be used to manage both <strong>financial and personal matters</strong> (depending on your state laws)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of POA is commonly chosen by people who want to prepare for the possibility of <strong>future health issues</strong>, such as dementia or serious medical conditions. Your chosen Attorney can make decisions about:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Managing your money, property, or business</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Handling your bills, investments, and assets</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Making arrangements for your care and living situation (if authorised)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Supportive Power of Attorney</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>Supportive Power of Attorney</strong> is a more <strong>collaborative legal tool</strong> designed to <strong>empower people with cognitive disabilities or impairments</strong>. Instead of giving someone else full decision-making power, this POA allows the appointed person (called a <strong>supporter</strong>) to <strong>help the principal make their own decisions</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The supporter can assist by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Accessing and explaining information to the person</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Helping communicate decisions to others</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Assisting with understanding options or consequences</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike other types of POA, the principal <strong>remains in control</strong> and continues making their own decisions &mdash; the supporter&rsquo;s role is to provide help <strong>without overriding their autonomy</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Should You Set Up a POA?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a Power of Attorney, decisions about your health, finances, and personal life may fall to others who don&rsquo;t know your wishes. By setting up a POA, you ensure your trusted Attorney will step in when needed. It&rsquo;s your way of securing control over your future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does It Protect You?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Attorney can make decisions about:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Finances:</strong> Paying bills, managing investments, selling property</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Personal Care:</strong> Healthcare, living arrangements, and day-to-day needs</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Specific Matters:</strong> Handling specific assets or issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You can even appoint multiple Attorneys and specify how they make decisions (together or separately).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Attorney&rsquo;s Duties: What You Should Know</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Attorneys must act in your best interests&mdash;making decisions based on your preferences and ensuring that they avoid conflicts of interest. They&rsquo;re legally bound to manage your affairs responsibly and with transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Should You Appoint?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose someone trustworthy, responsible, and willing to act on your behalf when needed. Think about their reliability, availability, and capacity for making important decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting It Up: Fast &amp; Simple</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting up a POA involves:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Choosing your Attorney and defining their powers.</li>\r\n	<li>Getting it witnessed by two independent witnesses (including one authorized professional, like a lawyer).</li>\r\n	<li>Signing the document and distributing certified copies to your Attorney and relevant institutions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Wait? Plan for the Future Today</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A Power of Attorney helps protect your interests, ensuring that your affairs are managed just the way you would. It&rsquo;s simple, but incredibly important. At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we make the process straightforward and hassle-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Let&rsquo;s Secure Your Future Together</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t leave your future to chance&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au\">contact Bansal Lawyers</a>, the best lawyers in the field, to set up a Power of Attorney and ensure that your decisions are always in trusted hands.</p>\r\n<!-- Full Blog Content -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mt-5 row\" id=\"blog-content\" style=\"display:none\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<div class=\"bg-dark p-4 text-white\" style=\"border-radius:5px\">\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'Secure your future with a Power of Attorney from Bansal Lawyers.

It plays an essential role in ensuring that the actions of government institutions are transparent, accountable, and fair. Whether you are dealing with a government agency on an immigration matter, tax issue, or appeal to a tribunal, understanding administrative law is vital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong>, we specialize in providing legal advice and support in various aspects of administrative law. Below, we outline what administrative law regulates, how it works, and how it promotes accountability in government decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does Administrative Law Regulate?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrative law regulates the activities of the executive branch of the government. This branch includes government agencies and officials who are responsible for creating rules, making decisions, and enforcing laws. Specifically, administrative law focuses on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Rulemaking:</strong> The process through which government agencies create new regulations or modify existing ones.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Adjudication:</strong> The process by which agencies make decisions in individual cases, such as issuing fines or approving licenses.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> Ensuring compliance with government regulations and statutes, often carried out by agencies such as the police or other regulatory bodies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/understanding-administrative-law-bansal-lawyers\">How Does Administrative Law Work?</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrative law controls how government agencies and officials make decisions and exercise their powers. These powers are typically outlined in specific legislation and are known as &quot;statutory functions.&quot; Agencies and officials are required to act within the scope of their statutory authority when making decisions, ensuring that they follow the law, respect individual rights, and act within their legal framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its core, administrative law provides a system of checks and balances to ensure that government decisions are made in a fair, just, and accountable manner. This system helps prevent the abuse of power by government officials and institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Does Administrative Law Include?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the federal level, administrative law covers a wide range of issues, including but not limited to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/migration-law\">Immigration Law</a>:</strong> Regulations concerning immigration status, visa applications, deportations, and refugee matters.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Tax Law:</strong> Rules and procedures for taxation, including audits, disputes, and tax assessments.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Centrelink Matters:</strong> Administrative decisions relating to welfare benefits and public assistance programs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Tribunal Appeals:</strong> Appeals related to decisions made by government agencies, such as those heard by the Administrative Review Tribunals (ART), previously called Administrative Appeals Tribunals (AAT).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrative law impacts individuals and businesses in many ways, particularly when engaging with government bodies. A well-informed understanding of your rights and obligations within this framework is essential to navigating these interactions successfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does Administrative Law Promote Accountability?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the primary functions of administrative law is to promote accountability in government decision-making. It ensures that government actions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Decisions must be made publicly and be subject to review.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Rational:</strong> Government agencies must make decisions based on logical reasoning and established facts.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Fair:</strong> The processes involved in decision-making must be just and equitable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure these principles are upheld, administrative law provides several mechanisms for review, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Merits Review:</strong> This involves examining the substance of a government decision to determine whether it is correct or fair.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Ombudsman Investigations:</strong> Independent investigations into government actions and complaints, aiming to resolve disputes and address grievances.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Judicial Review:</strong> The court&#39;s oversight of government decisions to ensure they comply with the law.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These mechanisms help protect the rights of individuals, ensuring that decisions made by government agencies are not arbitrary and that they adhere to the principles of justice and fairness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Choose Bansal Lawyers?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/book-an-appointment\"><strong>Bansal Lawyers</strong></a>, we offer expert legal services in administrative law.

Here are the key consequences:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>1. <strong>Fines and Financial Penalties</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>If a party is found to have hidden assets or provided false financial information, the court may impose <strong>monetary fines</strong> as a punishment. These fines serve as both a deterrent and a penalty for non-compliance with court orders and disclosure obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>2. <strong>Loss of Credibility Before the Court</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Honesty is vital in family law proceedings. If the court discovers that one party has lied or concealed assets, that individual may <strong>lose credibility</strong>. This loss of trust can heavily influence the outcome of the case, particularly in disputes over property division or child custody, where character and honesty are considered.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>3. <strong>Imprisonment in Serious Cases</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>In the most serious instances, hiding assets may lead to <strong>criminal charges</strong>, such as <strong>perjury</strong> (lying under oath) or <strong>fraud</strong>. If convicted, individuals may face <strong>imprisonment</strong>, especially when the dishonesty is proven to be deliberate, ongoing, and significantly damaging.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>4. <strong>Criminal Charges</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Beyond family law, deceptive conduct during a divorce can result in <strong>criminal proceedings</strong>. Charges may include:</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Fraud</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Perjury</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Contempt of court</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>These charges can lead to a criminal record, further fines, and custodial sentences, thereby severely impacting a person&#39;s personal and professional life.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>5. <strong>Unfavourable Property Settlement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>If it&rsquo;s proven that one party has attempted to conceal assets, the court has the authority to <strong>redistribute property and financial resources</strong> in favour of the honest party. The court may award a <strong>larger share</strong> of the matrimonial pool to the disadvantaged party as a form of compensation for the dishonest behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>6. <strong>Reimbursement of Legal Costs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>Family court proceedings can become significantly more complex and prolonged when one party is dishonest. The court may order the party who concealed assets to <strong>pay the legal costs</strong> incurred by the other party, including additional investigation fees, forensic accountants, or legal consultations.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>7. <strong>Court-Ordered Compensation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n	<p>If the dishonest conduct caused direct <strong>financial harm or delay</strong>, the court may order <strong>specific compensation</strong> to the other party. This could be in the form of a lump sum or additional assets being transferred to balance the losses incurred due to the deceit.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In every divorce or property settlement case, both parties are under a strict <strong>legal duty of disclosure</strong>. This means you must provide complete, honest, and up-to-date information about your financial circumstances, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Bank accounts</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Investments and shares</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Real estate holdings</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Business interests</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Superannuation</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Debts and liabilities</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Any significant financial resources or income</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Full Disclosure Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The duty of disclosure ensures that the <strong>division of assets is just and equitable</strong>. It allows the court&mdash;and both parties&mdash;to have a complete understanding of the financial landscape before making binding decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failing to disclose assets, even unintentionally, can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Invalidate court orders</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Delay proceedings</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Invite severe penalties</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/understanding-family-law-court-fees-australia\">How to Protect Your Assets in a Divorce</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Legitimate ways to protect your assets during a divorce in Australia include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Enter into a Binding Financial Agreement (BFA):</strong> Establish clear asset division ahead of time.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Keep Clear Financial Records:</strong> Maintain detailed records to prevent misrepresentation of assets.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Identify All Assets:</strong> Ensure you account for all joint and separate assets.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Maintain Separate Bank Accounts:</strong> Keep finances separate to avoid complications.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Change Your Will and Beneficiary Nominations:</strong> Update these documents post-separation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Close Joint Credit Cards:</strong> Protect yourself from shared debt accumulation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Related Information on <a href=\"https://www.bansallawyers.com.au/family-law\">Divorce and Family Law in Australia</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Divorce Application Victoria:</strong> Learn about the application process and fees.

It can also affect taxes and personal liability. As your business grows or if your circumstances change, you can choose to change your business structure to better meet your evolving needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Business Structure</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Selecting the right business structure is a crucial decision that can impact your day-to-day operations, tax obligations, legal responsibilities, and potential for growth. Below are the essential factors to keep in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Decision-Making</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourself: <em>Who will make the critical decisions about running the business?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In a <strong>sole trader</strong> setup, you are the sole decision-maker, giving you complete control.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In a <strong>partnership</strong>, decisions are shared and typically outlined in a partnership agreement.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In a <strong>company</strong>, decisions are made by directors or a board, often with input from shareholders.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Tax Benefits and Liabilities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Different structures are taxed in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Sole traders</strong> and <strong>partnerships</strong> are taxed at individual tax rates, which may not be ideal for higher profits.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Companies</strong> are taxed at a flat corporate rate, which can offer benefits in higher-income situations and allows for tax planning strategies.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Sharing Profits and Losses</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>As a <strong>sole trader</strong>, you retain all profits&mdash;but also bear all losses personally.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In a <strong>partnership</strong>, profits and losses are split as agreed, which can influence your personal tax and financial liability.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Companies</strong> distribute profits through dividends, and shareholders only receive what&rsquo;s declared.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4.

(25, 1, 45509, NULL, 'In-person', 'Hi, I am Tasneem Tarannum Nova. I got recently 485 refusal with AFP check timing issue. Please see the excerpt from the decsion letter:\r\n\r\n\"A valid application for a Temporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa has been\r\nmade by the applicant.\r\nA visa cannot be granted unless the relevant criteria specified in the Migration Regulations\r\nare satisfied. In this case, I am not satisfied that clause 485.213 in Schedule 2 of the\r\nMigration Regulations is met. This clause provides that:\r\n485.213\r\n(1) When the application was made, it was accompanied by evidence that:\r\n(a) the applicant; and\r\n(b) each person included in the application who is at least 16;\r\nhad applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12 months\r\nimmediately before the day the application is made.\r\n(2) Subclause (1) does not apply to an applicant who meets the requirements of clause\r\n485.232, 485.233, 485.234 or 485.235.\r\nWhen a Temporary Graduate (Subclass 485) visa is lodged, it must be accompanied by\r\nevidence that the applicant has applied for an Australian Federal Police check during the 12\r\nmonths immediately before the day the application is made.\r\nAssessment\r\nOn 9 March 2025 the applicant lodged an application for a (Post-Higher Education Work\r\nstream) (Subclass 485) visa. The applicant declared Yes to:\r\nHave you and all persons included in this application who are 16 years of age or over,\r\napplied in the last 12 months to the Australian Federal Police for a check of criminal records?\r\nThe applicant provided the official invoice from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as\r\nsupporting evidence at the time of their application.\r\nOn 28 April 2025, the application was assessed by the delegate based on the evidence\r\nprovided with their application. The evidence provided specifies that the application for the\r\nAustralian Federal Police check was lodged on 9 March 2025, which is the same day the\r\nTemporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa was lodged.\r\nAs the applicant did not apply for an Australian Federal Police clearance during the\r\n12 months immediately before the day they lodged their visa application, I find the applicant\r\ndoes not satisfy the requirements of Regulation 485.213.\r\nDecision\r\nAs clause 485.213 is not met by the applicant, I find the criteria for the grant of a Temporary\r\nGraduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa in the Post-Higher Education Work stream are\r\nnot met by the applicant, and thus the applicant does not meet the criteria for the grant of a\r\nTemporary Graduate (Post Higher Education Work) visa. I therefore find the criteria for the\r\ngrant of a Temporary Graduate visa are not met by the applicant.\r\nTherefore, I refuse the application by the applicant for a Temporary Graduate visa.\r\nAs the application has been assessed as not meeting the requirements of clause 485.213, I\r\nhave not assessed the application further against the requirements of this subclass.\"\r\n\r\nCould you please have a call with me and let me know. I am really bad place and feeling completely lost.', '2025-04-29 19:58:53', '2025-04-29 19:58:53', 0, 'client', 0, NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Only Partnership VISA withdrawn and a letter was sent by home affairs stating the relationship has ended.\r\n3) Also Fear wife will apply for a divorce in Australia and use the proceedings to just to learn of husbands Personal details to provide for Indian courts? Wife is very vindictive.\r\n4) Is the Indian Judicial system able to reach out to me here in Australia and compel and force me to appear in court in Indian? Given that allegations (unfounded) made by the wife are serious - treated as criminal in India e.g. Allegations of Abuse etc.\r\n5) Upon visiting India - given even allegations (although false and unfounded) can result in non-bailable jail time till the process is concluded in court - Can I be detained if I visit India - seeking precautions and safety advice as an Australian citizen with essentially no Links in India other than this marriage.\r\n6) Will you be able to assist in helping the Husband in navigating this matter while collaborating with an Indian Legal Representative? You will also need to help me source a competent Indian Legal Representative.\r\nCONTEXT\r\n1) During the time of marriage Q1 2018 - Husband was an Australian citizen (No ID in India except for OCI) - wife was an Indian citizen.\r\n2) Marriage Certificate was obtained in India\r\n3) Partner visa applied in Australia by husband. Relationship issues ensued, husband withdrew the application. Wife accused (unfounded and false) DV (no substantiation - home affairs is non-judicial process) to get her permanent residency VISA - Wife obtained it in 2023\r\n4) Husband and Wife are living separately since June 2022. The acute time of relationship breakdown. Started much earlier. Wife was falsely accusing husband and family of many allegations to husbands friends and family + Indian charity ISC (Indian Support Center) since DEC 2021.\r\n5) Unknown if Wife has obtained Australian Citizenship\r\n6) Wife has sent email to me with false allegations of abuse/desertion etc. and asking for a mutual divorce if not she threatens court proceedings with above allegations. Asking for personal details (to serve court documents). Last week.\r\n7) Above actions seems out of the blue as couple were in a phase of reconciliation since Q3 2024 (still living separately). She supposedly went to visit her family in India. Calls were being declined. Then suddenly this email was sent. \r\n8) Wife followed up with WhatsApp messages, got ISC to reach out via email and tried to contact extended family - asking for husband person details for serving of court orders.\r\n9) Husband has not responded to anything. He is in a state of pain/sadness/disdain but also fears for consequences having heard the Indian Judicial system\'s biases etc. Wishes to Seek legal advice in Australia before doing so.', '2025-05-12 01:54:17', '2025-05-12 01:54:17', 0, 'client', 0, NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\">: The Court applied the established test from CNY17 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (2019) 268 CLR 76, which asks &quot;whether a hypothetical fair-minded observer with knowledge of the statutory framework and factual context might reasonably apprehend that the administrator might not bring an impartial mind to

jurisdictional error without the need to prove materiality - meaning the applicant did not need to demonstrate that the outcome would have been different without the

The case involved Ms Ritika Thakur, her husband Anand Singh Cheema, and their child Viraaj Singh Cheema.

Ms Thakur sought review under section 476 of the Migration Act 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court considered whether the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error, particularly by recording her arrival date incorrectly and by failing to consider material evidence about her ties to India and family circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Issues</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Failure to properly assess Ms Thakur&rsquo;s <strong>GTE statement</strong> and evidence of ties to India.</li>\r\n	<li>Excessive reliance on immigration history instead of present circumstances.</li>\r\n	<li>Procedural unfairness by not allowing her to address adverse concerns.</li>\r\n	<li>Failure to consider the <strong>best interests of the child</strong> (s.60CC Family Law Act 1975).</li>\r\n	<li>Critical factual error: recording her arrival as 2008 instead of 2014.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Applicant&rsquo;s Arguments</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Strong family, social and financial ties to India, including ancestral property and care responsibilities for her mother.</li>\r\n	<li>Course choice explained by family circumstances (death of brother, mother&rsquo;s ill health).</li>\r\n	<li>Hospitality course intended to support business plans in India.</li>\r\n	<li>Tribunal placed undue emphasis on past visa history without considering explanations.</li>\r\n	<li>Incorrect arrival date unfairly suggested 10+ years in Australia.</li>\r\n	<li>Impact on her young child overlooked.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Minister&rsquo;s Response</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Tribunal considered all relevant evidence including immigration history.</li>\r\n	<li>Arrival date error not material to outcome.</li>\r\n	<li>Child welfare provisions under Family Law Act not applicable to migration review.</li>\r\n	<li>Procedural fairness requirements were met.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Court&rsquo;s Findings</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Most complaints went to weight of evidence &mdash; not reviewable.</li>\r\n	<li>A <strong>jurisdictional error</strong> was established because the Tribunal relied on the wrong arrival date (2008 vs 2014).</li>\r\n	<li>This error was material &mdash; it shaped reasoning about her length of stay in Australia.</li>\r\n	<li>Other grounds (Direction 69 misapplication, fairness, unreasonableness) dismissed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Decision and Orders</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Tribunal&rsquo;s 2019 decision was <strong>set aside</strong>.</li>\r\n	<li>Matter <strong>remitted</strong> for reconsideration according to law.</li>\r\n	<li>A <strong>writ of mandamus</strong> issued requiring the Tribunal to review afresh.</li>\r\n	<li>Minister ordered to pay applicants&rsquo; costs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Significance</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Migration review decisions must rest on accurate factual findings.</li>\r\n	<li>Even &ldquo;small&rdquo; errors (arrival dates) may amount to jurisdictional error.</li>\r\n	<li>Courts do not reassess merits but ensure legal errors are corrected.</li>\r\n	<li>Applicants must clearly present and emphasise critical factual evidence before the Tribunal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>This case summary is for general information purposes only and is based on publicly available court findings.
